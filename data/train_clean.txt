Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist
Instructions
The questions on the back page are designed to stimulate dialogue between you and your patients and to help
confirm if they may be suffering from the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Description:  The Symptom Checklist is an instrument consisting of the eighteen DSM-IV-TR criteria.
Six of the eighteen questions were found to be the most predictive of symptoms consistent with
ADHD.  These six questions are the basis for the ASRS v1.1 Screener and are also Part A of the
Symptom Checklist.  Part B of the Symptom Checklist contains the remaining twelve questions.
Instructions:
Symptoms
1. Ask the patient to complete both Part A and Part B of the Symptom Checklist by marking an X
in the box that most closely represents the frequency of occurrence of each of the symptoms.
2. Score Part A.  If four or more marks appear in the darkly shaded boxes within Part A then the
patient has symptoms highly consistent with ADHD in adults and further investigation is
warranted.
3. The frequency scores on Part B provide additional cues and can serve as further probes into the
patient's symptoms.  Pay particular attention to marks appearing in the dark shaded boxes.  The
frequency-based response is more sensitive with certain questions.  No total score or diagnostic
likelihood is utilized for the twelve questions. It has been found that the six questions in Part A
are the most predictive of the disorder and are best for use as a screening instrument.
Impairments
1. Review the entire Symptom Checklist with your patients and evaluate the level of impairment
associated with the symptom.
2. Consider work/school, social and family settings.
3. Symptom frequency is often associated with symptom severity, therefore the Symptom
Checklist may also aid in the assessment of impairments.  If your patients have frequent
symptoms, you may want to ask them to describe how these problems have affected the ability
to work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people such as their
spouse/significant other.
History
1. Assess the presence of these symptoms or similar symptoms in childhood.  Adults who have
ADHD need not have been formally diagnosed in childhood.  In evaluating a patient's history,
look for evidence of early-appearing and long-standing problems with attention or self-control.
Some significant symptoms should have been present in childhood, but full symptomology is not
necessary.

Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist
Please answer the questions below, rating yourself on each of the criteria shown using the
scale on the right side of the page. As you answer each question, place an X in the box that
best describes how you have felt and conducted yourself over the past 6 months. Please give
this completed checklist to your healthcare professional to discuss during today's
appointment.
Patient Name Today's Date
1. How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project,
once the challenging parts have been done?
2. How often do you have difficulty getting things in order when you have to do
a task that requires organization?
3. How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations?
4.
5. How often do you fidget or squirm with your hands or feet when you have
to sit down for a long time?
6. How often do you feel overly active and compelled to do things, like you
were driven by a motor?
7. How often do you make careless mistakes when you have to work on a boring or
difficult project?
8. How often do you have difficulty keeping your attention when you are doing boring
or repetitive work?
9. How often do you have difficulty concentrating on what people say to you,
even when they are speaking to you directly?
10. How often do you misplace or have difficulty finding things at home or at work?
11. How often are you distracted by activity or noise around you?
12. How often do you leave your seat in meetings or other situations in which
you are expected to remain seated?
13. How often do you feel restless or fidgety?
14. How often do you have difficulty unwinding and relaxing when you have time
to yourself?
15. How often do you find yourself talking too much when you are in social situations?
16. When you're in a conversation, how often do you find yourself finishing
the sentences of the people you are talking to, before they can finish
them themselves?
17. How often do you have difficulty waiting your turn in situations when
turn taking is required?
18. How often do you interrupt others when they are busy?
Part B
Part A
When you have a task that requires a lot of thought, how often do you avoid
or delay getting started?
The Value of Screening for Adults With ADHD
Research suggests that the symptoms of ADHD can persist into adulthood, having a significant
impact on the relationships, careers, and even the personal safety of your patients who may
suffer from it.1-4 Because this disorder is often misunderstood, many people who have it do not
receive appropriate treatment and, as a result, may never reach their full potential. Part of the
problem is that it can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in adults.
The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist was developed
in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Workgroup on Adult
ADHD that included the following team of psychiatrists and researchers:
•  Lenard Adler, MD
Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology
New York University Medical School
•  Ronald C. Kessler, PhD
Professor, Department of Health Care Policy
Harvard Medical School
•  Thomas Spencer, MD
Associate Professor of Psychiatry
Harvard Medical School
As a healthcare professional, you can use the ASRS v1.1 as a tool to help screen for ADHD in
adult patients. Insights gained through this screening may suggest the need for a more in-depth
clinician interview. The questions in the ASRS v1.1 are consistent with DSM-IV criteria and
address the manifestations of ADHD symptoms in adults. Content of the questionnaire also
reflects the importance that DSM-IV places on symptoms, impairments, and history for a correct
diagnosis.4
The checklist takes about 5 minutes to complete and can provide information that is critical
to supplement the diagnostic process.

personality types - temperament traits

Thomas, Chess & Birch ~
human personality traits
The New York Longitudinal Study, started in 1956 and continued over several decades thereafter, is regarded as a classic
study into personality types and temperament traits.
The study, conducted amongst young children, in its early days had such persons as Alexander Thomas, Stella Chess,
Herbert G. Birch and Margaret Hertzig as principal contributors.
The New York Longitudinal Study investigations included direct observation and also interviews with parents about their
children.
The team came up with ways of investigating individual styles of personality and temperament amongst children and
discovered ways of identifying and giving a relevant rating to nine separate "qualities" associated with personality and
temperament.
In analysing their data, the nine characteristics that were identified by the team as being reliably scorable on a three-point
scale (medium, high and low) were:-
1. the level and extent of motor activity;
2. the rhythmicity, or degree of regularity, of functions such as eating, elimination and the cycle of sleeping and
wakefulness;
3. the response to a new object or person, in terms of whether the child accepts the new experience or withdraws from
it;
4. the adaptability of behavior to changes in the environment;
5. the threshold, or sensitivity, to stimuli;
6. the intensity, or energy level, of responses;
7. the child's general mood or "disposition", whether cheerful or given to crying, pleasant or cranky, friendly or
unfriendly;
8. the degree of the child's distractibility from what he is doing;
9. the span of the child's attention and his persistence in an activity.
The set of ratings in these nine characteristics were held to define the temperament, or behavioural profile, of each child.
Such profiling was held to be reliable even as early as the age of two or three months. The team found that the nine
qualities could be identified and rated in a wide diversity of population samples they studied: be they rich, poor, of recent
immigrant background, mentally retarded children, children born prematurely or children with congenital rubella ("German
measles") related conditions the team were satisfied that they could reliably rate these nine personality / temperament
https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/index.html
https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/sitemap.html
characteristics.
When the researchers analysed the behavioural profiles of the children in an endeavour to find correlations among the nine
individual characteristics, they found that certain attributes did seem to cluster together. This clustering seemed to point
toward the definition of three general types of temperament (although quite a few of the children did not easily fit into any
of these three "types").
The "easy children"
This type - approximately forty per cent of the 141 children in the total sample were placed in this category - was
held to be characterised by positiveness in mood, regularity in bodily functions, a low or moderated intensity of
reaction, adaptability and positive approach to, rather than withdrawal from, new situations.
In infancy these children seemed to quickly establish regular sleeping and feeding schedules, were generally cheerful
and adapted quickly to new routines, new food and new people. As they grew older they learned the rules of new
games quickly, participated readily in new activities and adapted easily to school. This group was called the "easy
children", because they presented so few problems in care and training.
The "difficult children"
Another set of characteristics such as irregular in bodily functions, usual intensity in reactions, tendency to withdraw
in the face of new stimuli, relative slowness to adapt to changes in the environment and general negativity in mood
was deemed by the reseachers to be associable with another group that they labelled "difficult children".
As infants such children - comprising about ten per cent of the children sampled - were often irregular in feeding and
sleeping, were slower to accept new foods, took a longer time to adjust to new routines or activities and tended to cry
a great deal. Their crying and their laughter were rated as being characteristically loud. Frustrations usually seemed
to send them into violent tantrums. These children were, of course, something of a trial to their parents and required
a high degree of consistency and tolerance in their upbringing.
The "slow to warm up"
The children classified by the team as "slow to warm up" - fifteen per cent of the population sample studied -
typically had relatively low activity levels, tended to withdraw on their first exposure to new stimuli, were slower to
adapt, were somewhat negative in mood and responded to situations with a low intensity of reaction.
With some forty per cent being deemed to be "easy children", some ten per cent being deemed to be "difficult children",
and with some fifteen per cent being deemed to be "slow to warm up" only some sixty-five per cent of the children were
described as belonging to one or other of the three categories the study felt it appropriate to to define.
The remaining thirty-five per cent had such mixtures of the nine temperament traits as did not seem to allow classification
into one of the three groups.
There may well be an association to be made between the New York Longitudinal Study and the work of
Dr.William Sheldon who also researched into Human personality traits /
temperament types.
Some inkling of the potential far-reaching implications of the research by the New York Longitudinal Study and by Dr.
Sheldon into human personality and temperament traits can be gained through reading our page about the " Tripartite Soul
" of Humanity as identified by Plato and Socrates, by Shakespeare and by several Major World Religions:-
"...can we possibly refuse to admit that there exist in each of us the same generic parts and characteristics as are found in
the state? For I presume the state has not received them from any other source. It would be ridiculous to imagine that the
presence of the spirited element in cities is not to be traced to individuals, wherever this character is imputed to the people,
as it is to the natives of Thrace, and Scythia, and generally speaking, of the northern countries; or the love of knowledge,
which would be chiefly attributed to our own country; or the love of riches, which people would especially connect with the
Phoenicians and the Egyptians."
Socrates / Plato ~ Famous Philosophers who lived in Ancient Greece
"The first glance at History convinces us that the actions of men proceed from their needs, their passions, their characters
and talents; and impresses us with the belief that such needs, passions and interests are the sole spring of actions."
Georg Hegel, 1770-1831, German philosopher, The Philosophy of History (1837)

This 'knot of roots' insight features in:
Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous essay ~ 'History'
Ralph Waldo Emerson
RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803-1882) was, in his time, the leading voice of intellectual culture in the United States.
He remains widely influential to this day through his essays, lectures, poems, and philosophical writings.
In the later eighteen-twenties Ralph Waldo Emerson read, and was very significantly influenced by, a work by a French
philosopher named Victor Cousin.
A key section of Cousin's work reads as follows:
"What is the business of history? What is the stuff of which it is made? Who is the personage of history? Man : evidently
man and human nature. There are many different elements in history. What are they? Evidently again, the elements of
human nature. History is therefore the development of humanity, and of humanity only; for nothing else but humanity
develops itself, for nothing else than humanity is free. ...
... Moreover, when we have all the elements, I mean all the essential elements, their mutual relations do, as it were,
discover themselves. We draw from the nature of these different elements, if not all their possible relations, at least their
general and fundamental relations."
Introduction to the History of Philosophy (1829)
Even before he had first read Cousin, (in 1829), Emerson had expressed views in his private Journals which suggest that he
accepted that Human Nature, and Human Beings, tend to display three identifiable aspects and orientations:
Imagine hope to be removed from the human breast & see how Society will sink, how the strong bands of order &
improvement will be relaxed & what a deathlike stillness would take the place of the restless energies that now move the
world. The scholar will extinguish his midnight lamp, the merchant will furl his white sails & bid them seek the deep no
more. The anxious patriot who stood out for his country to the last & devised in the last beleagured citadel, profound
schemes for its deliverance and aggrandizement, will sheathe his sword and blot his fame. Remove hope, & the world
becomes a blank and rottenness. (Journal entry made between October and December, 1823)
In all districts of all lands, in all the classes of communities thousands of minds are intently occupied, the merchant in his
compting house, the mechanist over his plans, the statesman at his map, his treaty, & his tariff, the scholar in the skilful
history & eloquence of antiquity, each stung to the quick with the desire of exalting himself to a hasty & yet unfound
height above the level of his peers. Each is absorbed in the prospect of good accruing to himself but each is no less
contributing to the utmost of his ability to fix & adorn human civilization. (Journal entry of December, 1824)
Our neighbours are occupied with employments of infinite diversity. Some are intent on commercial speculations; some
engage warmly in political contention; some are found all day long at their books ... (This dates from January - February,
1828)
The quotes from Emerson are reminiscent of a line from another "leading voice of intellectual culture" - William
Shakespeare.
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee.
William Shakespeare: Henry IV (Pt 1), Act I, Scene II

The next question is going to ask you about how regular and long your menstrual cycles are.
What we mean when we ask about length is the number of days between the first day of one
period and the first day of the next period.
So, for example, if the first day that you started bleeding on your last period was 7th May
and the one before that was 10th April,  the length of that cycle was 27 days.
C6. Are your periods regular?
Yes occur every 23 days or less
Yes occur between 24 and 35 days
Yes occur more than every 35 days
No
No longer have periods

Explanatory Notes
K10
What is the K10 and how is it scored?
The K10 is widely recommended as a simple measure of psychological distress and as a measure
of outcomes following treatment for common mental health disorders. The K10 is in the public
domain and is promoted on the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression website
(www.crufad.org) as a self report measure to identify need for treatment.
The K10 uses a five value response option for each question – all of the time, most of the time,
some of the time, a little of the time and none of the time which can be scored from five through to
one.
The maximum score is 50 indicating severe distress, the minimum score is 10 indicating no
distress.
Questions 3 and 6 are not asked if the preceding question was 'none of the time' in which case
questions 3 and 6 would automatically receive a score of one.

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE (PANSS) RATING CRITERIA
GENERAL RATING INSTRUCTIONS
Data gathered from this assessment procedure are appl ied to the PANSS
ratings. Each of the 30 i tems is accompanied by a specif ic defini t ion as wel l
as detai led anchoring cri ter ia for al l  seven rat ing points. These seven points
represent increasing levels of psychopathology, as fol lows:
1- absent
2- minimal
3- mild
4- moderate
5- moderate severe
6- severe
7- extreme
In assigning rat ings, one f i rst considers whether an i tem is at al l  present,  as
judging by i ts defini t ion. I f  the i tem is absent,  i t  is scored 1, whereas i f  i t  is
present one must determine i ts severi ty by reference to the part icular cri ter ia
from the anchoring points. The highest appl icable rat ing point is always
assigned, even i f  the patient meets cri ter ia for lower points as wel l .  In
judging the level of severi ty,  the rater must ut i l ise a hol ist ic perspective in
deciding which anchoring point best characterises the pat ient's functioning
and rate accordingly, whether or not al l  elements of the descript ion are
observed.
The rating points of 2 to 7 correspond to incremental levels of symptom
severi ty:
•  A rat ing of 2 (minimal) denotes questionable or subtle or suspected
pathology, or i t  also may al lude to the extreme end of the normal
range.
•  A rat ing of 3 (mild) is indicative of a symptom whose presence is
clearly establ ished but not pronounced and interferes l i t t le in day-to-
day functioning.
•  A rat ing of 4 (moderate) characterises a symptom which, though
representing a serious problem, ei ther occurs only occasional ly or
intrudes on dai ly l i fe only to a moderate extent.
•  A rat ing of 5 (moderate severe) indicates marked manifestations that
dist inctly impact on one's functioning but are not al l -consuming and
usual ly can be contained at wi l l .
•  A rat ing of 6 (severe) represents gross pathology that is present very
frequently, proves highly disruptive to one's l i fe, and often cal ls for
direct supervision.
•  A rat ing of 7 (extreme) refers to the most serious level of
psychopathology, whereby the manifestations drastical ly interfere in
most or al l  major l i fe funct ions, typical ly necessitat ing close
supervision and assistance in many areas.
Each i tem is rated in consultat ion with the defini t ions and cr i teria provided in
this manual.  The rat ings are rendered on the PANSS rating form overleaf by
encircl ing the appropriate number fol lowing each dimension.

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS
Of the 30 i tems included in the PANSS, 7 const i tute a Positive Scale ,  7 a
Negative Scale ,  and the remaining 16 a General Psychopathology Scale .
The scores for these scales are arr ived at by summation of rat ings across
component i tems. Therefore, the potential  ranges are 7 to 49 for the Posit ive
and Negative Scales, and 16 to 112 for the General Psychopathology Scale.
In addit ion to these measures, a Composite Scale is scored by subtract ing
the negative score from the posit ive score. This yields a bipolar index that
ranges from –42 to +42, which is essential ly a di f ference score reflecting the
degree of predominance of one syndrome in relat ion to the other.
POSITIVE SCALE (P)
P1. DELUSIONS - Beliefs which are unfounded, unrealistic and idiosyncratic.
Basis for rating - Thought content expressed in the interview and its influence on
social relations and behaviour.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Presence of one or two delusions which are vague, uncrystallised and not
tenaciously held. Delusions do not interfere with thinking, social relations or behaviour.
4 Moderate - Presence of either a kaleidoscopic array of poorly formed, unstable delusions or a
few well-formed delusions that occasionally interfere with thinking, social relations or behaviour.
5 Moderate Severe - Presence of numerous well-formed delusions that are tenaciously held
and occasionally interfere with thinking, social relations and behaviour.
6 Severe - Presence of a stable set of delusions which are crystallised, possibly systematised,
tenaciously held and clearly interfere with thinking, social relations and behaviour.
7 Extreme - Presence of a stable set of delusions which are either highly systematised or very
numerous, and which dominate major facets of the patient's life. This frequently results in
inappropriate and irresponsible action, which may even jeopardise the safety of the patient or others.
P2. CONCEPTUAL DISORGANISATION - Disorganised process of thinking characterised by
disruption of goal-directed sequencing, e.g. circumstantiality, loose associations,
tangentiality, gross illogicality or thought block.
Basis for rating - Cognitive-verbal processes observed during the course of interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Thinking is circumstantial, tangential or paralogical. There is some difficulty in directing
thoughts towards a goal, and some loosening of associations may be evidenced under pressure.
4 Moderate - Able to focus thoughts when communications are brief and structured, but becomes
loose or irrelevant when dealing with more complex communications or when under minimal pressure.
5 Moderate Severe - Generally has difficulty in organising thoughts, as evidenced by frequent
irrelevancies, disconnectedness or loosening of associations even when not under pressure.
6 Severe - Thinking is seriously derailed and internally inconsistent, resulting in gross
irrelevancies and disruption of thought processes, which occur almost constantly.
7 Extreme - Thoughts are disrupted to the point where the patient is incoherent. There is marked
loosening of associations, which result in total failure of communication, e.g. "word salad" or mutism.
P3. HALLUCINATORY BEHAVIOUR - Verbal report or behaviour indicating perceptions which are
not generated by external stimuli. These may occur in the auditory, visual, olfactory or somatic realms.
Basis for rating - Verbal report and physical manifestations during the course of
interview as well as reports of behaviour by primary care workers or family.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - One or two clearly formed but infrequent hallucinations, or else a number of vague
abnormal perceptions which do not result in distortions of thinking or behaviour.
4 Moderate - Hallucinations occur frequently but not continuously, and the patient's
thinking and behaviour are only affected to a minor extent.
5 Moderate Severe - Hallucinations occur frequently, may involve more than one sensory modality,
and tend to distort thinking and/or disrupt behaviour. Patient may have a delusional interpretation of
these experiences and respond to them emotionally and, on occasion, verbally as well.
6 Severe - Hallucinations are present almost continuously, causing major disruption of
thinking and behaviour. Patient treats these as real perceptions, and functioning is impeded
by frequent emotional and verbal responses to them.
7 Extreme - Patient is almost totally preoccupied with hallucinations, which virtually dominate
thinking and behaviour. Hallucinations are provided a rigid delusional interpretation and
provoke verbal and behavioural responses, including obedience to command hallucinations.
P4. EXCITEMENT - Hyperactivity as reflected in accelerated motor behaviour, heightened
responsivity to stimuli, hypervigilance or excessive mood lability.
Basis for rating - Behavioural manifestations during the course of interview as well
as reports of behaviour by primary care workers or family.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Tends to be slightly agitated, hypervigilant or mildly overaroused throughout the interview, but
without distinct episodes of excitement or marked mood lability. Speech may be slightly pressured.
4 Moderate - Agitation or overarousal is clearly evident throughout the interview, affecting
speech and general mobility, or episodic outbursts occur sporadically.
5 Moderate Severe - Significant hyperactivity or frequent outbursts of motor activity are observed,
making it difficult for the patient to sit still for longer than several minutes at any given time.
6 Severe - Marked excitement dominates the interview, delimits attention, and to some
extent affects personal functions such as eating or sleeping.
7 Extreme - marked excitement seriously interferes in eating and sleeping and makes
interpersonal interactions virtually impossible. Acceleration of speech and motor activity
may result in incoherence and exhaustion.
P5. GRANDIOSITY - Exaggerated self-opinion and unrealistic convictions of superiority, including
delusions of extraordinary abilities, wealth, knowledge, fame, power and moral righteousness.
Basis for rating - Thought content expressed in the interview and its influence on
behaviour.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Some expansiveness or boastfulness is evident, but without clear-cut grandiose
delusions.
4 Moderate - Feels distinctly and unrealistically superior to others. Some poorly formed
delusions about special status or abilities may be present but are not acted upon.
5 Moderate Severe - Clear-cut delusions concerning remarkable abilities, status or power are
expressed and influence attitude but not behaviour.
6 Severe - Clear-cut delusions of remarkable superiority involving more than one parameter (wealth,
knowledge, fame, etc) are expressed, notably influence interactions and may be acted upon.
7 Extreme - Thinking, interactions and behaviour are dominated by multiple delusions of amazing
ability, wealth, knowledge, fame, power and/or moral stature, which may take on a bizarre quality.
P6. SUSPICIOUSNESS/PERSECUTION - Unrealistic or exaggerated ideas of persecution, as
reflected in guardedness, ad distrustful attitude, suspicious hypervigilance or frank
delusions that others mean harm.
Basis for rating – Thought content expressed in the interview and its influence on
behaviour.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Presents a guarded or even openly distrustful attitude, but thoughts, interactions and
behaviour are minimally affected.
4 Moderate - Distrustfulness is clearly evident and intrudes on the interview and/or behaviour, but
there is no evidence of persecutory delusions. Alternatively, there may be indication of loosely formed
persecutory delusions, but these do not seem to affect the patient's attitude or interpersonal relations.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient shows marked distrustfulness, leading to major disruption of
interpersonal relations, or else there are clear-cut persecutory delusions that have limited
impact on interpersonal relations and behaviour.
6 Severe - Clear-cut pervasive delusions of persecution which may be systematised and
significantly interfere in interpersonal relations.
7 Extreme - A network of systematised persecutory delusions dominates the patient's
thinking, social relations and behaviour.
P7. HOSTILITY - Verbal and nonverbal expressions of anger and resentment, including
sarcasm, passive-aggressive behaviour, verbal abuse and assualtiveness.
Basis for rating – Interpersonal behaviour observed during the interview and reports
by primary care workers or family.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Indirect or restrained communication of anger, such as sarcasm, disrespect, hostile
expressions and occasional irritability.
4 Moderate - Presents an overtly hostile attitude, showing frequent irritability and direct
expression of anger or resentment.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient is highly irritable and occasionally verbally abusive or threatening.
6 Severe - Uncooperativeness and verbal abuse or threats notably influence the interview and
seriously impact upon social relations. Patient may be violent and destructive but is not
physically assualtive towards others.
7 Extreme - Marked anger results in extreme uncooperativeness, precluding other
interactions, or in episode(s) of physical assault towards others.
NEGATIVE SCALE (N)
N1. BLUNTED AFFECT - Diminished emotional responsiveness as characterised by a
reduction in facial expression, modulation of feelings and communicative gestures.
Basis for rating - Observation of physical manifestations of affective tone and
emotional responsiveness during the course of the interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Changes in facial expression and communicative gestures seem to be stilted, forced,
artificial or lacking in modulation.
4 Moderate - Reduced range of facial expression and few expressive gestures result in a dull
appearance
5 Moderate Severe - Affect is generally 'flat' with only occasional changes in facial
expression and a paucity of communicative gestures.
6 Severe - Marked flatness and deficiency of emotions exhibited most of the time. There may
be unmodulated extreme affective discharges, such as excitement, rage or inappropriate
uncontrolled laughter.
7 Extreme – Changes in facial expression and evidence of communicative gestures are
virtually absent. Patient seems constantly to show a barren or 'wooden' expression.
N2. EMOTIONAL WITHDRAWAL - Lack of interest in, involvement with, and affective
commitment to life's events.
Basis for rating - Reports of functioning from primary care workers or family and
observation of interpersonal behaviour during the course of the interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Usually lack initiative and occasionally may show deficient interest in surrounding events.
4 Moderate - Patient is generally distanced emotionally from the milieu and its challenges
but, with encouragement, can be engaged.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient is clearly detached emotionally from persons and events in the milieu,
resisting all efforts at engagement. Patient appears distant, docile and purposeless but can be
involved in communication at least briefly and tends to personal needs, sometimes with assistance.
6 Severe - Marked deficiency of interest and emotional commitment results in limited conversation
with others and frequent neglect of personal functions, for which the patient requires supervision.
7 Extreme – Patient is almost totally withdrawn, uncommunicative and neglectful of
personal needs as a result of profound lack of interest and emotional commitment.
N3. POOR RAPPORT - Lack of interpersonal empathy, openness in conversation and sense of
closeness, interest or involvement with the interviewer. This is evidenced by interpersonal
distancing and reduced verbal and nonverbal communication.
Basis for rating - Interpersonal behaviour during the course of the interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Conversation is characterised by a stilted, strained or artificial tone. It may lack
emotional depth or tend to remain on an impersonal, intellectual plane.
4 Moderate - Patient typically is aloof, with interpersonal distance quite evident. Patient may
answer questions mechanically, act bored, or express disinterest.
5 Moderate Severe - Disinvolvement is obvious and clearly impedes the productivity of the
interview. Patient may tend to avoid eye or face contact.
6 Severe - Patient is highly indifferent, with marked interpersonal distance. Answers are perfunctory,
and there is little nonverbal evidence of involvement. Eye and face contact are frequently avoided.
7 Extreme - Patient is totally uninvolved with the interviewer. Patient appears to be completely
indifferent and consistently avoids verbal and nonverbal interactions during the interview.
N4. PASSIVE/APATHETIC SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL - Diminished interest and initiative in
social interactions due to passivity, apathy, anergy or avolition. This leads to reduced
interpersonal involvements and neglect of activities of daily living.
Basis for rating – Reports on social behaviour from primary care workers or family.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Shows occasional interest in social activities but poor initiative. Usually engages with
others only when approached first by them.
4 Moderate – Passively goes along with most social activities but in a disinterested or
mechanical way. Tends to recede into the background.
5 Moderate Severe - Passively participates in only a minority of activities and shows virtually
no interest or initiative. Generally spends little time with others.
6 Severe - Tends to be apathetic and isolated, participating very rarely in social activities and
occasionally neglecting personal needs. Has very few spontaneous social contacts.
7 Extreme – Profoundly apathetic, socially isolated and personally neglectful.
N5. DIFFICULTY IN ABSTRACT THINKING - Impairment in the use of the abstract-symbolic
mode of thinking, as evidenced by difficulty in classification, forming generalisations and
proceeding beyond concrete or egocentric thinking in problem-solving tasks.
Basis for rating - Responses to questions on similarities and proverb interpretation,
and use of concrete vs. abstract mode during the course of the interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Tends to give literal or personalised interpretations to the more difficult proverbs
and may have some problems with concepts that are fairly abstract or remotely related.
4 Moderate - Often utilises a concrete mode. Has difficulty with most proverbs and some
categories. Tends to be distracted by functional aspects and salient features.
5 Moderate Severe - Deals primarily in a concrete mode, exhibiting difficulty with most
proverbs and many categories.
6 Severe - Unable to grasp the abstract meaning of any proverbs or figurative expressions
and can formulate classifications for only the most simple of similarities. Thinking is either
vacuous or locked into functional aspects, salient features and idiosyncratic interpretations.
7 Extreme - Can use only concrete modes of thinking. Shows no comprehension of proverbs,
common metaphors or similes, and simple categories. Even salient and functional attributes
do not serve as a basis for classification. This rating may apply to those who cannot interact
even minimally with the examiner due to marked cognitive impairment.
N6. LACK OF SPONTANEITY AND FLOW OF CONVERSATION - Reduction in the normal flow
of communication associated with apathy, avolition, defensiveness or cognitive deficit. This
is manifested by diminished fluidity and productivity of the verbal interactional process.
Basis for rating - Cognitive-verbal processes observed during the course of interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild – Conversation shows little initiative. Patient's answers tend to be brief and
unembellished, requiring direct and leading questions by the interviewer.
4 Moderate – Conversation lacks free flow and appears uneven or halting. Leading questions
are frequently needed to elicit adequate responses and proceed with conversation.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient shows a marked lack of spontaneity and openness, replying to
the interviewer's questions with only one or two brief sentences.
6 Severe - Patient's responses are limited mainly to a few words or short phrases intended to
avoid or curtail communication. (e.g. "I don't know", "I'm not at liberty to say").
Conversation is seriously impaired as a result and the interview is highly unproductive.
7 Extreme - Verbal output is restricted to, at most, an occasional utterance, making
conversation not possible.
N7. STEREOTYPED THINKING - Decreased fluidity, spontaneity and flexibility of thinking, as
evidenced in rigid, repetitious or barren thought content.
Basis for rating - Cognitive-verbal processes observed during the interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Some rigidity shown in attitude or beliefs. Patient may refuse to consider alternative
positions or have difficulty in shifting from one idea to another.
4 Moderate - Conversation revolves around a recurrent theme, resulting in difficulty in
shifting to a new topic.
5 Moderate Severe - Thinking is rigid and repetitious to the point that, despite the
interviewer's efforts, conversation is limited to only two or three dominating topics.

GENERAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY SCALE (G)
G1. SOMATIC CONCERN - Physical complaints or beliefs about bodily illness or malfunctions. This
may range from a vague sense of ill being to clear-cut delusions of catastrophic physical disease.
Basis for rating - Thought content expressed in the interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Distinctly concerned about health or bodily malfunction, but there is no delusional
conviction and overconcern can be allayed by reassurance.
4 Moderate - Complains about poor health or bodily malfunction, but there is no delusional
conviction, and overconcern can be allayed by reassurance.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient expresses numerous or frequent complaints about physical
illness or bodily malfunction, or else patient reveals one or two clear-cut delusions
involving these themes but is not preoccupied by them.
6 Severe - Patient is preoccupied by one or a few clear-cut delusions about physical disease
or organic malfunction, but affect is not fully immersed in these themes, and thoughts can
be diverted by the interviewer with some effort.
7 Extreme – Numerous and frequently reported somatic delusions, or only a few somatic
delusions of a catastrophic nature, which totally dominate the patient's affect or thinking.
G2. ANXIETY - Subjective experience of nervousness, worry, apprehension or restlessness,
ranging from excessive concern about the present or future to feelings of panic.

behavioural consequences are reported or evidenced.
4 Moderate - Patient reports distinct symptoms of nervousness, which are reflected in mild
physical manifestations such as fine hand tremor and excessive perspiration.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient reports serious problems of anxiety which have significant
physical and behavioural consequences, such as marked tension, poor concentration,
palpitations or impaired sleep.
6 Severe - Subjective state of almost constant fear associated with phobias, marked
restlessness or numerous somatic manifestations.

his life but is not pre-occupied with it and attitude and behaviour are essentially unaffected.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient expresses a strong sense of guilt associated with self-
deprecation or the belief that he deserves punishment. The guilt feelings may have a
delusional basis, may be volunteered spontaneously, may be a source of preoccupation
and/or depressed mood, and cannot be allayed readily by the interviewer.
6 Severe - Strong ideas of guilt take on a delusional quality and lead to an attitude of hopelessness
or worthlessness. The patient believes he should receive harsh sanctions as such punishment.
7 Extreme - Patient's life is dominated by unshakable delusions of guilt, for which he feels
deserving of drastic punishment, such as life imprisonment, torture, or death. There may be

pessimism, loss of social interest, psychomotor retardation and some interference in
appetite and sleep. The patient cannot be easily cheered up.
6 Severe - Markedly depressed mood is associated with sustained feelings of misery, occasional
crying, hopelessness and worthlessness. In addition, there is major interference in appetite and
or sleep as well as in normal motor and social functions, with possible signs of self-neglect.
7 Extreme - Depressive feelings seriously interfere in most major functions. The
manifestations include frequent crying, pronounced somatic symptoms, impaired

Basis for rating - Thought content expressed during the course of interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Thought content is somewhat peculiar, or idiosyncratic, or familiar ideas are framed in an odd context.
4 Moderate - Ideas are frequently distorted and occasionally seem quite bizarre.

Having hundreds of children, receiving radio messages from outer space from a tooth filling).
6 Severe - Patient expresses many illogical or absurd ideas or some which have a distinctly
bizarre quality (e.g. having three heads, being a visitor from another planet).
7 Extreme - Thinking is replete with absurd, bizarre and grotesque ideas.
G10. DISORIENTATION - Lack of awareness of one's relationship to the milieu, including
persons, place and time, which may be due to confusion or withdrawal.
Basis for rating - Responses to interview questions on orientation.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - General orientation is adequate but there is some difficulty with specifics. For example,  patient
knows his location but not the street address, knows hospital staff names but not their functions, knows
the month but confuses the day of the week with an adjacent day, or errs in the date by more than two
days. There may be narrowing of interest evidenced by familiarity with the immediate but not extended
milieu, such as ability to identify staff but not the mayor, governor, or president.
4 Moderate - Only partial success in recognising persons, places and time. For example, patient knows he is in a
hospital but not its name, knows the name of the city but not the borough or district, knows the name of his
primary therapist but not many other direct care workers, knows the year or season but not sure of the month.
5 Moderate Severe - Considerable failure in recognising persons, place and time. Patient has only a
vague notion of where he is and seems unfamiliar with most people in his milieu. He may identify
the year correctly or nearly but not know the current month, day of week or even the season.
6 Severe - Marked failure in recognising persons, place and time. For example, patient has no knowledge of his
whereabouts, confuses the date by more than one year, can name only one or two individuals in his current life.
7 Extreme - Patient appears completely disorientated with regard to persons, place and time.
There is gross confusion or total ignorance about one's location, the current year and even
the most familiar people, such as parents, spouse, friends and primary therapist.
G11. POOR ATTENTION - Failure in focused alertness manifested by poor concentration, distractibility
from internal and external stimuli, and difficulty in harnessing, sustaining or shifting focus to new stimuli.
Basis for rating – Manifestations during the course of interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Limited concentration evidenced by occasional vulnerability to distraction and
faltering attention toward the end of the interview.
4 Moderate - Conversation is affected by the tendency to be easily distracted, difficulty in long
sustaining concentration on a given topic, or problems in shifting attention to new topics.
5 Moderate Severe - Conversation is seriously hampered by poor concentration,
distractibility, and difficulty in shifting focus appropriately..
6 Severe - Patient's attention can be harnessed for only brief moments or with great effort,
due to marked distraction by internal or external stimuli.
7 Extreme - Attention is so disrupted that even brief conversation is not possible.
G12. LACK OF JUDGEMENT AND INSIGHT - Impaired awareness or understanding of one's own
psychiatric condition and life situation. This is evidenced by failure to recognise past or present
psychiatric illness or symptoms, denial of need for psychiatric hospitalisation or treatment, decisions
characterised by poor anticipation or consequences, and unrealistic short-term and long-range planning.
Basis for rating – Thought content expressed during the interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Recognises having a psychiatric disorder but clearly underestimates its seriousness, the implications for
treatment, or the importance of taking measures to avoid relapse. Future planning may be poorly conceived.
4 Moderate - Patient shows only a vague or shallow recognition of illness. There may be fluctuations in
acknowledgement of being ill or little awareness of major symptoms which are present, such as
delusions, disorganised thinking, suspiciousness and social withdrawal. The patient may rationalise the
need for treatment in terms of its relieving lesser symptoms, such as anxiety, tension and sleep difficulty.
5 Moderate Severe - Acknowledges past but not present psychiatric disorder. If challenged, the patient
may concede the presence of some unrelated or insignificant symptoms, which tend to be explained away by
gross misinterpretation or delusional thinking. The need for psychiatric treatment similarly goes unrecognised.
6 Severe - Patient denies ever having had a psychiatric disorder. He disavows the presence of any psychiatric
symptoms in the past or present and, though compliant, denies the need for treatment and hospitalisation.
7 Extreme - Emphatic denial of past and present psychiatric illness. Current hospitalisation and treatment
are given a delusional interpretation (e.g. as punishment fro misdeeds, as persecution by tormentors, etc),
and the patient thus refuse to cooperate with therapists, medication or other aspects of treatment.
G13. DISTURBANCE OF VOLITION – Disturbance in the wilful initiation, sustenance and
control of one's thoughts, behaviour, movements and speech.
Basis for rating - Thought content and behaviour manifested in the course of interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - There is evidence of some indecisiveness in conversation and thinking, which may
impede verbal and cognitive processes to a minor extent.
4 Moderate - Patient is often ambivalent and shows clear difficulty in reaching decisions.
Conversation may be marred by alteration in thinking, and in consequence, verbal and
cognitive functioning are clearly impaired.
5 Moderate Severe - Disturbance of volition interferes in thinking as well as behaviour.
Patient shows pronounced indecision that impedes the initiation and continuation of social
and motor activities, and which also may be evidence in halting speech.
6 Severe - Disturbance of volition interferes in the execution of simple automatic motor
functions, such as dressing or grooming, and markedly affects speech.
7 Extreme – Almost complete failure of volition is manifested by gross inhibition of movement
and speech resulting in immobility and/or mutism.
G14. POOR IMPULSE CONTROL - Disordered regulation and control of action on inner urges, resulting in sudden,
unmodulated, arbitrary or misdirected discharge of tension and emotions without concern about consequences.
Basis for rating – Behaviour during the course of interview and reported by primary
care workers or family.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Patient tends to be easily angered and frustrated when facing stress or denied
gratification but rarely acts on impulse.
4 Moderate - Patient gets angered and verbally abusive with minimal provocation. May be occasionally
threatening, destructive, or have one or two episodes involving physical confrontation or a minor brawl.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient exhibits repeated impulsive episodes involving verbal abuse,
destruction of property, or physical threats. There may be one or two episodes involving
serious assault, for which the patient requires isolation, physical restraint, or p.r.n. sedation.
6 Severe - Patient frequently is impulsive aggressive, threatening, demanding, and destructive,
without any apparent consideration of consequences. Shows assualtive behaviour and may
also be sexually offensive and possibly respond behaviourally to hallucinatory commands.
7 Extreme - Patient exhibits homicidal, sexual assaults, repeated brutality, or self-destructive behaviour. Requires
constant direct supervision or external constraints because of inability to control dangerous impulses.
G15. PREOCCUPATION - Absorption with internally generated thoughts and feelings and with
autistic experiences to the detriment of reality orientation and adaptive behaviour.
Basis for rating - Interpersonal behaviour observed during the course of interview.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Excessive involvement with personal needs or problems, such that conversation
veers back to egocentric themes and there is diminished concerned exhibited toward others.
4 Moderate - Patient occasionally appears self-absorbed, as if daydreaming or involved with
internal experiences, which interferes with communication to a minor extent.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient often appears to be engaged in autistic experiences, as evidenced by
behaviours that significantly intrude on social and communicational functions, such as the presence
of a vacant stare, muttering or talking to oneself, or involvement with stereotyped motor patterns.
6 Severe - Marked preoccupation with autistic experiences, which seriously delimits
concentration, ability to converse, and orientation to the milieu. The patient frequently may
be observed smiling, laughing, muttering, talking, or shouting to himself.
7 Extreme - Gross absorption with autistic experiences, which profoundly affects all major
realms of behaviour. The patient constantly may be responding verbally or behaviourally to
hallucinations and show little awareness of other people or the external milieu.
G16. ACTIVE SOCIAL AVOIDANCE - Diminished social involvement associated with
unwarranted fear, hostility, or distrust.
Basis for rating - Reports of social functioning primary care workers or family.
1 Absent - Definition does not apply
2 Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
3 Mild - Patient seems ill at ease in the presence of others of others and prefers to spend
time alone, although he participates in social functions when required.
4 Moderate - Patient begrudgingly attends all or most social activities but may needs to be
persuaded or may terminate prematurely on account of anxiety, suspiciousness, or hostility.
5 Moderate Severe - Patient fearfully or angrily keeps away from many social interactions
despite others' efforts to engage him. Tends to spend unstructured time alone.
6 Severe - Patient participates in very few social activities because of fear, hostility, or distrust. When approached, the
patient shows a strong tendency to break off interactions, and generally he tends to isolate himself from others.
7 Extreme - Patient cannot be engaged in social activities because of pronounced fears, hostility, or
persecutory delusions. To the extent possible, he avoids all interactions and remains isolated from others.

Section B:    Memories of real events
We are interested  in your memory for events that have happened in your life. For each
of the following words we would like you to think of an event that happened to you
which the word reminds you of. The event could have happened recently (e.g.
yesterday, last week) or a long time ago. It might be an important event, or a trivial
event.
The memory you write down should be for a real event. So if we said "good" – it would
not be OK to say "I always enjoy a good party" because this does not mention a
specific event. But it would be OK to say "I had a good time at Jane's party" because
that is a real event.
Please write the real event you remember in this column.
If you can't think of an event, just leave that space blank.
a)  Happy

Thank you for logging on to complete the online questionnaire.
Please make sure you have read the booklet we sent you, called "WHAT WOULD WE LIKE
YOU TO DO? INFORMATION FOR STUDY MEMBERS". If you don't have it to hand, you can
find a copy here. If you have any questions before you start the questionnaire, you can call

INTROYPCAWI2
(DISPLAY TO ALL)
We'd like you to answer some questions about different things in your life. You can stop at
any time. It is not a test so there are no right or wrong answers. If you don't want to answer
a question that's ok, you can skip it.  If you wish to go back and change an answer that
you've given, click 'Back'.  It usually takes about 15 minutes. Some of the questions are
about things that are personal so please make sure you fill in the questionnaire on your
own. We'd like to remind you that all the answers you give will be completely confidential.
We hope that you find the questions interesting and enjoy answering them.
INTROYPCAWI3
(DISPLAY TO ALL)
Some questions are about things that are more personal. Remember no-one in your family
will see your answers. If you come to a question that you don't want to answer that's ok.
You can skip it and move to the next one by pressing 'next'.
Some questions are about things that not all young people your age will have done. That's
ok – we're just as interested in what people haven't done as well as what they have. It's
important that you answer honestly.

Development and Validation of the Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS)
Shawn O. Utsey and Joseph G. Ponterotto
Fordham University at Lincoln Center
This article describes the development and validation of a measure of the stress experienced
by African Americans as a result of their daily encounters with racism and discrimination.
The Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS) is a 46-item instrument developed according to the
theoretical framework of daily hassles (R. S. Lazarus & S. Folkman, 1984) and integrated
with P. Essed's (1990) concept of everyday racism. The IRRS has adequate indexes of
internal consistency and fair-to-adequate estimates of test-retest stability. Several subscales
of the IRRS and a global racism index were correlated with other measures of stress and
racism. Furthermore, the IRRS discriminated between Blacks and non-Blacks in a group-
differences study. Both principal-components and confirmatory factor analyses supported a
4-component model of race-related stress.
Racism and acts of discrimination against African Amer-
icans have taken on various forms over the past 350 years,
ranging from lynchings, burnings, beatings, and other forms
of direct violence to more subtle slights and innuendoes
(Duckitt, 1992; Ponterotto & Pederson, 1993; Thompson,
Neville, Weathers, Poston, & Atkinson, 1990). There have
been several scholarly works of historical significance ex-
amining the nature of racism and discrimination in relation
to the experiences of African Americans in the United
States (e.g., Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Duc-
kitt, 1992; Essed, 1990; Myrdal, 1944; Jones, 1972; Petti-
grew, 1964; Simpson & Yinger, 1985). For the most part,
racism has been of interest primarily to social psychologists
who study the development and expression of prejudice and
in-group/out-group attitudes, or sociologists who are pri-
marily concerned with the outcome effects of racism and
discrimination on groups of people within society. How-
ever, psychologists have more recently begun to examine
the clinical significance of racism and its relationship to the
psychological well-being of African Americans who expe-
rience it as a chronic stressor in their daily lives (see Burke,
1984; Fernando, 1984; Jackson, Williams, & Torres, 1995;
McNeilly et al., in press; Smith, 1985; White & Parham,
1990).
Despite some perceived progress made in U.S. race rela-
tions over the last three decades, many writers believe that
for African Americans, racism continues to be an inescap-
able and painful reality of daily life (Essed, 1990; Feagin &
Shawn O. Utsey and Joseph G. Ponterotto, Psychological and
Educational Services, Fordham University at Lincoln Center.

Sikes, 1994; McNeilly et al., in press). Essed (1990), in her
groundbreaking qualitative study of the daily experiences of
Blacks with racism, described the chronic nature of the
stress associated with racism this way: "to live with the
threat of racism means planning, almost everyday of one's
life, how to avoid or defend oneself against discrimination"
(p. 260). The experience of racism for African Americans is
cumulative, whereby new encounters are interpreted on the
basis of past experiences with racism, knowledge of others'
experience with racism, and knowledge about the systemic
nature of racism (Essed, 1990; Feagin & Sikes, 1994).
According to Dovidio and Gaetner (1986) racism is em-
bedded in the "social norms, institutional policies, and cog-
nitive and affective systems of White Americans" (p. xi)
and as a result has a significant adverse impact on the
quality of life for African Americans. Racism can occur in
three spheres: (a) individual racism, experienced on a per-
sonal level; (b) institutional racism, experienced as a result
of racism being embedded in the policies of a given insti-
tution; and (c) cultural racism, results from the cultural
practices of one group being lauded as superior to those of
another (Essed, 1990; Jones, 1972). Essed (1990) extended
the individual realm of racism to include collective racism.
Collective racism occurs when organized (or semiorga-
nized) Whites/non-Blacks seek to restrict the rights of
Blacks (e.g., when a Black family moves into a White
community and is met with open hostility by its new neigh-
bors). Because of the omnipresence of racism, it makes
intuitive sense that any effort to study its impact on African
Americans would focus on the multidimensional character
of its expression and experience.
Due to the insidiousness of everyday racism, empirical
examination of this construct can be an arduous task. Con-
sequently, past research has generally focused on examining
the most overt acts of racism experienced by African Amer-
icans. However, the racism experienced by African Amer-
icans throughout the day—whether at work, in public
places, in route to and from their homes, or on television
and other popular media outlets—for the most part has
remained unexamined (Essed, 1990). The greatest challenge

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 491
faced by researchers who wish to measure the stressful
effects of everyday racism is to first identify it. The diffi-
culty of this task is exacerbated by the fact that everyday
racism is often covert and can be subtle, elusive, or seem-
ingly intangible to those who experience it in their daily
lives (Dovidio, 1993; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Essed,
1990).
The stress associated with the experience of discrimina-
tion has been implicated in the development of psychiatric
disorders such as depression (Burke, 1984), antisocial be-
havior (Simpson & Yinger, 1985), lowered self-esteem
(Fernando, 1984), lowered levels of general happiness and
life satisfaction (Jackson et al., 1995), and poor academic
performance (Gougis, 1986). The deleterious effect on the
psychological health of African Americans that may result
from everyday racism is significant and should be addressed
by counseling psychologists and other mental health prac-
titioners. When providing psychological services to African
American clients, counselors can include an assessment,
possibly during the intake process, of the extent to which
racism and discrimination might be related to the client's
presenting problem or problems, or in some way interfering
with the client's current level of functioning (Smith, 1985).
Consequently, there is a strong need for a self-administered,
psychometrically sound (and relatively brief) measure of the
magnitude and range of an individual's experiences with
racism and discrimination (Outlaw, 1993).
Previous attempts to quantitatively examine the experi-
ences of African Americans with racism have resulted in the
development of several paper-and-pencil self-report instru-
ments, none of which have been published in the major
psychological journals. These efforts have been aimed at
examining the cognitive processes, emotional responses,
and the behavioral reactions associated with the experience
of racism and discrimination as reported by African Amer-
icans. The measures of racism currently available include
the Racial Discrimination Index (RDI; Terrell & Miller,
1980), the Racism Reaction Scale (RRS; Thompson et al.,
1990), the Perceived Racism Scale (PRS; McNeilly et al., in
press), and the Racism and Life Experience Scales—Brief
Version (RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994). In spite of several the-
oretical and methodological limitations, these attempts to
quantify the experiences of African Americans with racism
and discrimination have made a substantial contribution to
the empirical examination of the stressful effects of racism.
A psychometrically sound self-report instrument that
measures the stress associated with daily encounters of
racism and discrimination experienced by African Ameri-
cans is needed. Such an instrument, if used in a clinical
setting, would allow for the effective and efficient assess-
ment of the experience of race-related stress and its impact
on the psychological functioning of an individual. Having a
valid and reliable self-report measure available to determine
the extent to which racism adversely affects an individual's
psychological well-being would aid in the diagnosis and
treatment of some psychological and somatic stress-related
disorders prevalent in the African American community.
Furthermore, a measure of race-related stress would have
implications as a research tool, which would effectively
allow for an examination of the relationship between racism
and some of the stress-induced psychological and somatic
health problems of African Americans. Other possibilities
for research inquiry include the relationship between the
stressful experience of racism and discrimination and racial-
identity development among African Americans. One could
also examine the relationship between the stressful effects
of racism and the impact of the counselor's willingness to
address these issues on counseling outcomes for African
Americans.
The Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS) is intended to
provide a much needed measure of the stress associated
with the experiences of racism and discrimination encoun-
tered by African Americans in their daily lives. The theo-
retical framework of the IRRS is grounded in the daily
hassles conceptualization of life stress proposed by Lazarus
and Folkman (1984) and integrated with Essed's (1990)
concept of everyday racism. The IRRS samples the occur-
rence and perceived magnitude of stressful race-related
events occurring daily in the lives of African Americans.
The ERRS also takes into account the stressful effects of
network events, which are stressful events that happen to
family members and people one cares about (Feagin &
Sikes, 1994; Thoits, 1991). According to Lazarus and Folk-
man (1984), "it is perfectly appropriate to measure stress as
either input, response, or strained relationship" (p. 307).
Furthermore, they posit that stress can be envisioned as a
general concept much like emotion, motivation, or cogni-
tion, but operationalized according to the perceived magni-
tude of the interactions with the environment that tax or
exceed the person's resources. Accordingly, the IRRS mea-
sures race-related stress operationalized as the occurrence
and perceived magnitude of specific events of racism and
discrimination that African Americans potentially experi-
ence in their daily lives.
In the development of the IRRS as a measure of race-
related stress, the researchers sought to answer several sig-
nificant and related questions. First, is the experience of
racism that African Americans encounter in their daily lives
a multidimensional phenomenon that occurs across domains
(i.e., institutionally, culturally, etc.)? Second, would the
IRRS correlate with other measures of stress and racism,
thereby proving itself to be a valid measure of race-related
stress within its own right? Furthermore, could the IRRS be
proven as a reliable measure of race-related stress on the
basis of indexes of internal consistency and stability over
time? Finally, because the IRRS is intended to measure the
stress associated with everyday racism as uniquely experi-
enced by African Americans, would it effectively discrim-
inate between Blacks and non-Blacks?
On the basis of a review of the literature (Essed, 1990;
Feagin & Sikes, 1994; Jones, 1972), an examination of
existing measures of racism (RDI; Terrell & Miller, 1980;
RRS; Thompson et al., 1990; PRS; McNeilly et al., in press;
RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994), and a pilot study, we anticipated
that the IRRS would sample the multidimensionality of
racism. More specifically, on the basis of the pilot study and
the model of racism posited by Jones (1972) and later
expanded on by Essed (1990), we hypothesized that the

principal-component structure of the IRRS would produce a
three- or four-component model. Using one of the racism
measures currently in existence (RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994;
see Instruments), the researchers also hypothesized that the
IRRS and the RaLES-B would be positively correlated on
measures representing comparable domains of racism (i.e.,
RaLES-B Group and the IRRS' measure of cultural racism)
as well as their global measures of racism. It was also
hypothesized that the IRRS subscales and global measure
would be positively correlated with another measure of
stress (PSS; Cohen, Karmarck, & Mermelstein, 1983; see
Instruments). Finally, the researchers hypothesized that the
IRRS would discriminate between Blacks and non-Blacks,
with Blacks having higher indicators of race-related stress.
General Method
Item Development
The development of the initial items included on the IRRS was
based on informal interviews with African Americans from diverse
backgrounds (both men and women), a review of the literature, and
the personal life experiences of the primary researcher (a male
African American). Efforts were made to ensure that the items
could be easily understood by someone reading at the eighth-grade
level or higher. The researchers reviewed all potential items for
redundancy, and those found to be repetitious were eliminated
from the scale. On the basis of these procedures, a total of 74 items
were generated and placed on a 5-point Likert-type scale. If an
individual was the victim of a racist or discriminatory act, they
were to indicate their reaction to the event on the basis of the
following response choices: 1 = no reaction, 2 = irritation, 3 =
anger, 4 = hostility, 5 = rage. Individuals were to respond only to
those events that they experienced, leaving the ones they did not
experience blank.
Content Validity
To aid in assessing the content validity of the IRRS, a focus
group composed of 5 African Americans was facilitated by the
primary researcher for approximately 2
x
h hr. In addition to eval-
uating the content validity of the IRRS, it was examined for its
efficiency of administration and any potential harmful effects that
might result from its completion. The group members completed
the IRRS and a discussion concerning its structure, item clarity,
item domain appropriateness, and the comprehensiveness of the
scale ensued.
As a result of the focus group, concerns were raised that resulted
in several changes being made to the IRRS. First, the original
5-point Likert-type scale (1 = no reaction; 2 = irritation; 3 =
anger; 4 = hostility; and 5 = rage), on which group members
found it difficult to differentiate between several of the response
choices (i.e., anger, hostility, and rage), was changed (1 = unaf-
fected by the event; 2 = slightly bothered by the event; 3 = event
was upsetting; and 4 = extremely upset by event) to allow respon-
dents to more clearly distinguish between their reactions. Second,
some of the events were ambiguous and needed clarification.
Third, the group pointed out that several significant events fitting
the criteria for inclusion were omitted (i.e., events relating to the
race-sex dynamic).
In addition to the focus group, five individuals (who were not
part of the focus group) with extensive research backgrounds on
racial-ethnic, gender, and cultural issues examined the IRRS items
for their clarity and domain appropriateness. Each expert judge,
who was a published scholar in the topical area, rated the items on
the IRRS using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = confusing; 2 =
ambiguous; 3 = fairly clear; and 4 = very clear) to indicate the
item's clarity. The domain appropriateness of each item was rated
as yes or no. Those items receiving a mean rating of less than 3.0
on item clarity were either rewritten or eliminated. Items rated as
not being domain appropriate were likewise rewritten or elimi-
nated. The net result was an initial IRRS version consisting of 67
items with a total score range of 1 to 268, with higher scores
indicating a greater severity of race-related stress.
Pilot Study
Following the item development and content validity studies of
the IRRS, a pilot study was conducted with 377 participants from
various geographic locations throughout the United States. The
sample consisted of 203 women and 163 men (11 missing gender
variables) with ages ranging from 17 to 57, with a mean age of
22.65 years (SD = 6.85). One purpose of the pilot study was to
determine the logistics of the IRRS's administration, such as the
time it takes to complete, the readability and clarity of the items,
the clarity of the IRRS instructions, and the content validity of the
IRRS items, with a sample of participants similar in demographic
background to the target population. Another purpose of the pilot
study was to conduct a preliminary examination of the IRRS's
factor structure for an informal comparison to Jones's (1972)
three-tier model of racism and Essed's (1990) four-tier model.
Based on the results of the pilot study, several changes were
made to the IRRS. Foremost, it was discovered that during the
pilot study many of the questionnaires were incorrectly completed.
The researchers suspected that requiring participants to check
some items, while leaving others blank, was confusing. As a result,
a new Likert-type scale on which no items are left blank was
designed (0 = This has never happened to me; 1 = This event
happened, but did not bother me; 2 = This event happened and I
was slightly upset; 3 = This event happened and I was upset; 4 =
This event happened and I was extremely upset). This response
rating scale is consistent with those used on other stress-related
measures (i.e., Daily Hassles Scale; Kanner, Coyne, Schafer, &
Lazarus, 1980; Perceived Stress Scale, Cohen et al., 1983; Ways of
Coping Scale, Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).
Using only those surveys that were completed correctly, a
principal-components analysis was performed on all 67 items of
the IRRS. This procedure yielded 17 factors with eigenvalues of
greater than 1.0. However, a scree test (Cattell, 1965) indicated
that as many as four factors were interpretable. Consequently, the
researchers forced a one-, two-, three-, and four-component ex-
traction using both an orthogonal and oblique solution. The most
interpretable of the four extractions, and consistent with the liter-
ature on the multidimensionality of racism (i.e., Essed, 1990;
Jones, 1972), was the three-component orthogonal solution. Com-
ponent 1 (eigenvalue = 13.6), with 25 items, accounted for 20% of
the common variance; Component 2 (eigenvalue = 3.4), with 20
items, accounted for 5.1% of the common variance; and Compo-
nent 3 (eigenvalue = 3.0), with 15 items, accounted for 4.6% of
the common variance. The criteria for retaining items were as
follows: (a) items with component loadings of .35 or higher were
selected; (b) items meeting the .35 criteria on more than one
component were eliminated.
From the results of the principal-components analysis, a total of
eight items were eliminated on the basis of the selection criteria.
An additional item was dropped on the basis of the researchers'

judgment. Thus, the current version of the IRRS comprised 59
items in total.
Study 1
The purpose of Study 1 was to determine the principal-
component structure of the revised IRRS by conducting a
second principal-components analysis. In addition to deter-
mining the component structure of the IRRS, indexes of
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) were computed for
each of the components extracted during this study. Fur-
thermore, Pearson's product-moment correlation coeffi-
cients were calculated to determine the relationship between
the IRRS subscales.
The IRRS is intended for use with individuals identifying
themselves as African American. As the IRRS is intended
for use with African American adults in general, the re-
searchers attempted to sample a heterogeneous population
for Study 1. Only those individuals over the age of 17 were
included in this study, as the scale is designed to measure
race-related stress in African American adults. Moreover,
various geographic regions, educational levels, and socio-
economic levels are represented in the sample.
Method
Sample. The total sample for Study 1 included 302 participants
from Greensboro, NC, and New York City. In an effort to obtain
a sample demographically similar to the target population, partic-
ipants were selected from a variety of settings: colleges and
universities, a substance abuse treatment facility, and the commu-
nity at large. It is significant to note that there were no incorrectly
completed surveys in this study. There were approximately 10
surveys that were incomplete or suspected of being invalid. A total
of 7 individuals refused to participate, primarily non-Blacks who
found the material offensive. Participants in Study 1 did not take
part in the pilot study.
Of the 302 participants in Study 1, 167 (55%) were female and
115 (38%) were male (19 missing values). Their ages ranged from
18 to 61 years, with a mean age of 26.77 (SD = 9.02). The sample
included 90% American-born Blacks (8% represent Caribbean-
born Blacks; 2% = missing values). Geographically, the sample
included 188 participants from the New York City region and 113
from North Carolina (1 missing value). Of the entire sample, 35%
were from the community at large, 51 % were college students, and
13% were residents in a substance abuse treatment facility. The
marital status of the sample included 76% single, 13% married, 5%
separated, and 1% widowed. For the entire sample, 29% were
employed, with 17% earning between $10,000 and $25,000 annu-
ally, and 28% earning below $10,000. Only 10% of those em-
ployed earned more than $25,000 annually. The sample's mean
years of education was 13.79.
Procedure. In cases in which the IRRS was sent away for data
collection, it was administered by doctoral-level proctors who had
been thoroughly briefed in the proper protocol for its administra-
tion. In all other cases, the primary researcher was responsible for
administration of the questionnaires. The survey was completed
anonymously, and participation was on a voluntary basis. Each
survey included a cover letter and demographic questionnaire. In
the cover letter a statement was issued to the effect that by
completing the questionnaire, informed consent could be assumed.
The survey generally took 20 to 30 min to complete, dependent on
the average reading ability of the group.
The recruitment of participants was aided by a lottery held as an
incentive for participation in the study. Individuals who agreed to
participate were given a lottery number, and a drawing was held at
the conclusion of each data collection session. The winner received
a $25 cash prize. The participants were debriefed individually or in
groups following the collection of data.
Results
IRRS component structure. A principal-components
analysis was again performed on all items of the IRRS. This
time the procedure yielded 15 components with eigenvalues
of greater than 1.0. Once more, a scree test (Cattell, 1965)
indicated that as many as four components were interpret-
able. As a result, one-, two-, three-, and four-component
extractions were forced using both an oblique and orthog-
onal rotation method. For this study the most interpretable
of the four extractions, and the one conceptually supported
by the literature (see Essed's, 1990, Collective Racism as an
extension of the three-tier model proposed by Jones, 1972),
was the four-component orthogonal solution.
The four-component orthogonal solution accounted for
38% of the common variance, as did the oblique solution,
but the orthogonal solution loaded items to components that
were consistently more logical than the oblique. The criteria
for retaining items to the scale were as follows: (a) items
were required to have a component loading of .40 or higher
to be selected, and (b) items meeting the .40 criteria must
also have been at least .15 greater than all other items
loading on the same component. See Table 1 for IRRS
items, component loadings, communalities, and item means
and standard deviations.
Component 1 (eigenvalue = 13.36) was responsible for
23% of the common variance, with 16 items loading on this
component. These items represent the experience of racism
on a cultural level. Component 2 (eigenvalue = 4.58) was
responsible for 8% of the common variance, with 11 items
meeting the selection criteria. For the most part these items
represent the experience of racism on an institutional level.
Component 3 (eigenvalue = 2.45) accounted for 4% of the
common variance, with 11 items meeting the criteria for
selection. The general theme of these items relates to the
experience of racism on an individual level. Component 4
(eigenvalue = 2.06) accounted for 3% of the common
variance, with 8 items meeting the criteria for selection. The
concept of collective racism, an extension of individual
racism (Essed, 1990), accounts for the general theme of this
component.
Internal consistency and subscale inter correlations.
The coefficient alphas for the new IRRS subscales were .87
for Component 1, Cultural Racism; .85 for Component 2,
Institutional Racism; .84 for Component 3, Individual Rac-
ism; and .79 for Component 4, Collective Racism.
Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were
calculated to determine the subscale intercorrelations of the

correlations, the IRRS subscales are best conceptualized as
related yet distinct measures of the stress experienced by
African Americans in their encounters with racism and
discrimination.

496 UTSEY AND PONTEROTTO
Study 2
A second study was conducted to examine other forms of
construct validity for the IRRS. First of all, a confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) of the IRRS component structure was
conducted. A CFA is an effective and powerful method for
investigating the construct validity of a measure (Rahim &
Magner, 1995). Also, in an effort to establish the concurrent
validity of the Index of Race-Related Stress, we adminis-
tered simultaneously a second measure of the perceived
stressful magnitude of racism and discrimination
(RaLES-B) as well as a second measure of perceived stress
(Perceived Stress Scale). Furthermore, we used the group-
differences method (see Cronbach & Meehl, 1955) for es-
tablishing construct validity by comparing IRRS subscale
scores for Blacks with the scores of a subsample of non-
Blacks (Whites and Asians; n = 31). Moreover, indexes of
internal consistency for the IRRS subscales were again
calculated.
Method
Sample. The total sample size for Study 2 was 341 participants,
including a subsample of 31 non-Blacks used for the group-
comparison validity procedure. The non-Black subsample was not
included in any data analysis other than the group-comparison
procedure. In this study, as with the previous one, participants
were selected from colleges, universities, and the community at
large. Again, there is representation of African Americans from a
wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, geographic regions,
and educational levels.
For Blacks exclusively, the total sample size in Study 2 was 310.
Of this number, 207 (67%) were female and 92 (30%) were male.
Their ages ranged from 17 to 76 years, with a mean age of 23.38
(SD = 7.74). This sample included 87% American-born Blacks
(12% represent Caribbean-born Blacks; missing values = 4). Geo-
graphically, the sample for Study 2 included 153 participants from
Washington, DC, and 157 from New York City. Of the entire
sample, 16% were from the community at large and the remainder
were college students representing various colleges and universi-
ties in the Northeast. The marital status of the sample was 85%
single, 9% married, 3% separated, 2% divorced, and 6% widowed.
For participants in the community sample, 6.7% were employed.
Of this group the annual income was $10,000 or less for the
majority of participants. The mean years of education for the
community-at-large sample was 12.39.
In the non-Black subsample (n = 31), there were 23 Whites and
8 Asians. The non-Black subsample had an age range of 19 to 47
years, with a mean of 27.97 (SD = 7.64). There were 16 women
(55%) and 15 men (45%). The mean for years of education in the
non-Black subsample was 13.74 (SD = 3.97). The marital status of
the subsample was 78% single, 16% married, and 6% divorced.
The majority of participants in the non-Black subsample also had
an annual income level below $10,000.
Instruments. The RaLES-B is a self-report measure that sam-
ples the minority group members' perceptions of the impact of
racism on their lives. Part I of the scale produces a Perceived
Racism—Self total score and consists of 20 items, with a range
from 0-80. Part II produces a Perceived Racism—Group total
score and consists of 12 items, with a range from 0-48. The
RaLES, in a study on the adaptive functioning of African Amer-
ican adolescents (Wells, 1995), was reported to have a Cronbach's
alpha of .88 for the Racism—Self subscale and .90 for the
Racism—Group subscale. In addition, Racism—Self was signifi-
cantly correlated with the Immersion dimension of racial identity
(r = .26, p < .01) and with adaptive functioning (r = .18, p <
.05). Racism—Group was significantly correlated with both the
Encounter (r = .23, p < .01) and Internalization (r = .29, p < .01)
dimensions of racial identity development. In the current study the
RaLES-B Self and Group subscales had Cronbach alphas of .90
and .83, respectively (n = 55).
The Perceived Stress Scale is a 14 item Likert-type (item re-
sponse scale = 0-4) self-report measure of the degree to which
one views situations in his or her life as stressful. The PSS was
designed to assess the degree to which people find events in their
lives to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading. PSS
scores are calculated by first reversing the scores on 7 positive
items and then summing across all 14 items. In one study (Cohen
et al., 1983), the PSS was found to correlate positively and sig-
nificantly with Life Events Scores among two separate college
samples (.20 to .35, p < .01). Cohen et al. (1983) reported
Cronbach alphas of .84 and .85 for the two college samples and .86
for a smoking cessation sample. The PSS had a 2-day test-retest
correlation of .85 and a .55 correlation after 6 weeks. In the current
study, the PSS had a Cronbach's alpha of .70 (n = 51).
Procedure. A new sample of participants was recruited for
Study 2, of which most were participating on a volunteer basis, the
exception being one group of college students (n = 153), who
received extra class credit for participation. In administering the
IRRS, the same procedures as followed in the previous studies
were repeated. Participants were again debriefed individually or in
groups following the questionnaire's administration. All partici-
pants except those in the non-Black subsample were given the
same instructions for completing the IRRS. The non-Black sub-
sample was instructed to replace "Black" with their own racial
group identity; for example, instead of reading the item "you were
treated with less respect because you are Black," it would be "you
were treated with less respect because you are White (or Asian)."
As previously noted, two additional instruments were adminis-
tered simultaneously with the IRRS to two separate subsamples for
the purpose of establishing the scale's concurrent validity. The first
subsample (n = 51) received the PSS, randomly distributed over
the entire sample of Study 2. The second subsample (n = 57)
received the RaLES-B. These were also randomly distributed over
the entire sample. For the RaLES-B, the sequence in which the
surveys were administered was alternated to control for instrumen-
tation effects. However, the PSS was always placed before the
IRRS in its order in the survey package to prevent the participants
from being influenced in their responses to the PSS by the nature
of the IRRS items.
Results
Confirmatory factor analysis. A confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) was conducted on the 46 items of the IRRS,
using the LISREL 7 computer program (Joreskog & Sor-
bom, 1989). Comparisons were made between the identified
four-component orthogonal model, a four-component
oblique model, a global component model, and a null
model. Several indexes assessing the degree to which the
model fits the data were computed by the researchers for all
four competing models. First, a chi-square statistic was
computed for each of the models, including the null. It is
important to note that the chi-square statistic tends to be
affected by large sample sizes and will likely produce a

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 497
significant result in spite of a reasonable fit to the data
(Bentler & Bonett, 1980). In addition, significant chi-
squares will occur with models that have numerous vari-
ables and high degrees of freedom (Bryant & Yarnold,
1995).
By referring to Table 2 for a complete summary of the
results of the confirmatory factor analysis, it will be ob-
served that the chi-square statistic for all four competing
models was significant, suggesting an unsatisfactory fit.
Additionally, as indicated by all indexes used in this study
to evaluate the fit of the competing models, the four-
component oblique model had the greatest degree of fit
across all measures. The four-component oblique model
was the best fit because it had the lowest x2 value
(1,865.24), the highest goodness-of-fit index (GFI; .78) and
adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI; .76), the lowest -^Idf
value (1.89), the lowest root mean square residual (RMSR;
.080), and the highest relative noncentrality index (RNI;
.80). The RNI is also independent of sample size, and
according to Gerbing and Anderson (1993), the best avail-
able measure for determining the fit of structural equation
models.
Looking closely at these values, we would evaluate the
general fit of the proposed model as unsatisfactory. More
desirable fits have, for example, the GFI in the high .80s and
.90s. According to Bagozzi and Heatherton (1994), it is
common for measurement models to have an unsatisfactory
fit when more than four or five items represent each com-
ponent and the sample size is large. The poor fit in these
cases is likely to be related to several factors: (a) the
complexity of the models, (b) high levels of random error to
be found in a scale with many items, and (c) the many
parameters to be estimated. One method that has been
recommended (see Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994; Rahim &
Magner, 1995) to address this problem is to sum items
within each component, thus creating aggregate variables
that represent parallel indicators of the construct being
measured by the items. Items with the highest component
loadings are paired with items having the lowest component
loading in sequential order in which the first, second, and
third highest loadings are paired with their corresponding
lowest loadings, whereas the remaining items are randomly
distributed among the new indicator variables (see Mathieu,
1991). After the items have been aggregated to form new
and fewer indicators of the same construct, they are reen-
tered into the LISREL 7 program and subjected to a second
confirmatory factor analysis.
Using the method recommended by Bagozzi and Heath-
erton (1994) and Rahim and Magner (1995), the authors
created the following aggregate variables to be reanalyzed
using the LISREL 7 program: Cultural Racism 1 (Items 2,
15, 31, & 3); Cultural Racism 2 (Items 40, 44, 43, & 34);
Cultural Racism 3 (Items 8, 29, 21, & 35); Cultural Racism
4 (Items 13, 42, 23, & 37); Institutional Racism 1 (Items 18
& 46); Institutional Racism 2 (Items 12, 26, & 19); Insti-
tutional Racism 3 (Items 20,45, & 39); Institutional Racism
4 (Items 32,41, & 38); Individual Racism 1 (Items 9 & 33);
Individual Racism 2 (Items 22, 30, & 4); Individual Racism
3 (Items 5, 17, & 27); Individual Racism 4 (Items 1, 24, &
6); Collective Racism 1 (Items 14 & 16); Collective Racism
2 (Items 10 & 36); Collective Racism 3 (Items 7 & 25);
Collective Racism 4 (Items 11 & 28). Because these aggre-
gated variables represent new items of the same compo-
nents, Cronbach's alphas were again calculated. For Cul-
tural Racism, Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and
Collective Racism, the Cronbach alpha was .86, .77, .83,
and .75, respectively.
On review of the second confirmatory factor analysis
results found in Table 3, it will be observed that the fit
indexes for the four-component 16 aggregate variables im-
proved. The GFIs and AGFIs for both the orthogonal and
oblique models ranged from .78 to .90 and .71 to .86,
respectively. The RNIs for the orthogonal and oblique mod-
els ranged from .74 to .92, respectively. Although a better fit
for the proposed model (orthogonal) would have been de-
sirable, the primary objective of this study was to find the
best fit for the data among the competing models. Accord-
ing to Bryant and Yarnold (1995), the most common use of
a confirmatory factor analysis is to determine "whether a
particular factor model fits the data better than others" (p.
119). Consequently, and in contradiction to the hypothe-
sized model (four-component orthogonal model), the four-
component oblique model demonstrated the best overall fit
among the competing component models in this study (see
Table 3). That the four-component oblique model is the best
fit is not surprising given the moderate correlations found
between some subscales of the IRRS.
Internal consistency and intercorrelations of IRRS sub-
scales. Consistent with Study 1, the internal consistency of
the IRRS subscales was determined to be sufficiently ade-

bach's alpha of .89. Component 2, Institutional Racism,
obtained a Cronbach's alpha of .82. Component 3, Individ-
ual Racism, obtained a Cronbach's alpha of .84. For Com-
ponent 4, Collective Racism, Cronbach's alpha was .74.
Also consistent with Study 1, the IRRS subscale intercor-
relations were as follows: Cultural Racism correlated .37
with Institutional Racism, .53 with Individual Racism, and
.22 with Collective Racism, ps < .01. Institutional Racism
correlated .56 with Individual Racism and .66 with Collec-
tive Racism, ps < .01. Individual Racism correlated .51
with Collective Racism,/? < .01. Subscale intercorrelations
remain low to moderate, again suggesting that the IRRS is
measuring related yet distinct aspects of race-related stress.
Concurrent validity. To establish the concurrent validity
of the IRRS, Pearson product-moment correlation coeffi-
cients were computed between its four subscales, the
RaLES-B Self and Group subscales, and the PSS. In addi-
tion, an IRRS Global Racism score was calculated by con-
verting each subscale total score to a z score, thereby
weighting equally the contribution that each racism domain
contributes to the Global score. The IRRS Global Racism
score was then correlated with a global racism score for the
RaLES-B (Self and Group subscale score combined) and
the PSS.
The results of the Pearson product-moment correlation
procedure between the IRRS subscales, including the
Global Racism measure, and the RaLES-B are presented in
Table 4. A positive and significant correlation was found to
exist between Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, Indi-

vidual Racism, and the Group subscale of the RaLES-B.
Collective Racism did not significantly correlate with the
RaLES-B Group subscale. For the Self subscale of the
RaLES-B, there was a positive and significant correlation
with the Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and Col-
lective Racism subscales of the IRRS. The RaLES-B Self
subscale did not significantly correlate with the IRRS Cul-
tural Racism subscale. The IRRS Global Racism measure
was positively and significantly correlated with the
RaLES-B Global Racism measure.
To establish further evidence of the concurrent validity of
the IRRS' subscales and its Global Racism measure, a
second measure of stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et
al., 1983) was administered simultaneously. Consequently,
Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were
calculated on these variables. It can be observed, by refer-
ring to Table 4, that a positive and significant correlation
exists between Cultural Racism, Individual Racism, and the
PSS. Institutional Racism and Collective Racism were not
significantly correlated with the PSS. However, a positive
and significant correlation was found to exist between the
IRRS's Global Racism measure and the PSS.
Group differences. On the expectation that Blacks
would score significantly higher than non-Blacks on the
IRRS subscales, a multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA) comparing these two subsamples was per-
formed. Whites and Asians were combined for this analysis
on the basis of a MANOVA finding of no significant
difference between the groups' IRRS subscale scores, Ho-
tellings T
2
= F(4, 27) = 1.21, p = .32. The MANOVA
comparing Blacks with non-Blacks (Whites and Asians)
produced a significant result, Hotellings T
2
= .322, F(4,
336) = 27.04, p = .00. The Bonferroni formula was used to
control for the inflated alpha due to four follow-up univar-
iate ANOVAs. Alpha was set at .012. Subsequent univariate
F test and mean examination indicated that Blacks scored
significantly higher than non-Blacks on Cultural Racism,
F(l, 339) = 55.89, p < .00 (Blacks' M = 44.50, SD =
13.03; non-Blacks' M = 18.38, SD = 17.75); Institutional
Racism, F(l, 339) = 10.37, p < .00 (Blacks' M = 13.88,
SD = 9.88; non-Blacks' M = 6.22, SD = 5.63); Individual
Racism, F(\, 339) = 37.89, p < .00 (Blacks' M = 21.46,
SD = 10.39; non-Blacks' M = 10.12, SD = 6.93); and
Collective Racism, F(l, 339) = 15.27, p < .00 (Blacks'
M = 8.63, SD = 6.75; non-Blacks' M = 5.66, SD = 4.93).

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 499
Study 3
To establish the stability of the ERRS over time, two
separate samples were recruited for a test-retest adminis-
tration. In addition to using two separate samples, we used
different test-retest intervals in the IRRS's administration.
Method
Sample. The first sample was recruited from introductory psy-
chology classes at an historically Black college in Greensboro, NC
(n = 31). Of the 31 in this sample, 9 were men and 21 were women
(1 missing). The mean age of this group was 20.48 (5D = 3.78).
The participants in the second sample (n = 19) were recruited
from an adult education program located in New York City. Of
these participants, 4 were men and 15 were women. The mean age
for this group was 29.42 (SD = 9.42).
Procedure. The general procedures followed during regular
administrations of the IRRS were followed during Study 3 for both
test-retest samples. The IRRS was administered to the first sample
of participants on a designated day and then again 3 weeks later.
Likewise, the second sample of participants was administered the
IRRS on a designated day and men again 2 weeks later. In both
cases participants were debriefed individually or in groups.
Results
In the first sample the test-retest reliability coefficients
for Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, Individual Rac-
ism, and Collective Racism were .77, .69, .61, and .79,
respectively. In the second sample, the test-retest reliability
coefficients for Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, In-
dividual Racism, and Collective Racism were .58, .71, .54,
and .75, respectively.
Discussion
The current research sought to develop and validate a
paper-and-pencil self-report instrument that measures the
stress associated with the experience of racism in the daily
lives of African Americans. The theoretical framework un-
derlying the development of this measure was based on an
integration of the daily-hassles concept of stress (Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984) and the multidimensional conceptualization
of everyday racism posited by Essed (1990). The net result
of the preliminary phase of this study was a 46-item, self-
report instrument, intended for use with African American
adults from a wide range of demographic backgrounds.
A principal-components analysis and a confirmatory fac-
tor analysis supported a four-component structure as best
representing the experiences of racism in the daily lives of
African Americans. The four subscales of the IRRS repeat-
edly demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliabilities
over two separate studies. In addition, the subscale inter-
correlations were low to moderate across the two studies.
Moreover, the four subscales of the IRRS proved to be
consistent with Essed's (1990) conceptual model of every-
day racism; the following domains were represented by the
four-component structure: (a) cultural, (b) institutional, (c)
individual, (d) collective.
Initial evidence for the concurrent validity of the IRRS
subscales was established by using a second measure of
racism (RaLES-B) and a second measure of perceived
stress (PSS). Both the Self and Group subscales of
RaLES-B provided support for the concurrent validity of
the ERRS by positively and significantly correlating with
several of its subscales. The RaLES-B Group subscale, as
hypothesized, correlated positively and significantly with
the Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, and Individual
Racism subscales of the ERRS. The RaLES-B Self subscale
was significantly correlated (in a positive direction) with the
Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and Collective
Racism subscales of the ERRS. In addition, the IRRS Global
Racism measure was positively and significantly correlated
with the RaLES-B Global Racism measure. The fact that no
correlation was found between the RaLES-B Self subscale
and the Cultural Racism subscale of the IRRS is logical
given the divergent manifestations associated with these
two types of racism.
In a second correlational study, the PSS, as hypothesized,
correlated positively and significantly with the Cultural
Racism, Individual Racism, and a Global Racism measure
of the ERRS. The lack of a significant correlation between
the PSS and the other subscales of the IRRS might be
explained by several factors. For example, encounters with
institutional racism are likely to be less frequent than expo-
sure to cultural racism, and better concealed by the perpe-
trator or perpetrators than the direct encounters of individual
racism. The lack of a significant correlation of the Collec-
tive Racism measure and the PSS might be explained by the
extreme nature of these events and their low rate of inci-
dence among the current sample.
Using the group differences approach, the IRRS demon-
strated adequate criterion-related validity by discriminating
between Blacks and non-Blacks on its Cultural Racism,
Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and Collective
Racism subscales. As hypothesized, the IRRS performed
well as an index of the unique experiences and the magni-
tude of such experiences that African Americans have with
racism. The fact that the IRRS subscales discriminate be-
tween Blacks and non-Blacks provides further evidence for
the construct validity of the instrument.
Based on the results of two separate studies, using two
distinct samples, the test-retest reliability of the IRRS sub-
scales ranged from fair to adequate. In the first sample,
which consisted primarily of college students from the
South, the ERRS subscales obtained indexes of stability over
a 3-week period ranging from .61 to .79. In the second
study, with participants from an adult education program,
the indexes of stability for the IRRS subscales over a
2-week period ranged from .54 to .75. Indexes of stability
are considered adequate when they are in the .70 range. For
the IRRS subscales, the college sample obtained indexes
much more consistent with this criterion (i.e., .77, .69, .61,
and .79). This might be accounted for in part by the fact that
the college sample is from a historically Black college,
where the likelihood of having had any new encounters with

500 UTSEY AND PONTEROTTO
discrimination during the test-retest interval is reduced. On
the other hand, the sample from the adult education program
were exposed to events, including racism and discrimina-
tion, that might normally be experienced by African Amer-
icans in their daily contact with Whites and other non-
Blacks.
A potential criticism of the IRRS relates to the absence of
a time frame in which the participants are requested to recall
the occurrence of an event relating to racism or discrimina-
tion, or both, that they have experienced. The question
arises in this circumstance as to how accurate one can
remember his or her reaction to an event that occurred
several months ago, or even several years in the past.
However, assessing the stressful impact of African Ameri-
cans' experiences with racism is best served by not restrict-
ing the period of time in which it occurred; for as Feagin
and Sikes (1994) suggested, the effects of such traumatic
experiences are long lasting. Another potential criticism of
the IRRS and an ongoing issue in the field of stress research
relates to the potential confound between the occurrence of
race-related events and the intensity of such experiences.
Because participants who have not experienced a given
event are requested to select a response of 0, and those who
have had a given experience must select a response between
1 and 4, it might be argued that the two responses are
measures of separate constructs and should be analyzed
separately. This is a debatable issue (J. E. Holm, personal
communication, April 22, 1996; R. S. Lazarus, personal
communication, April 30, 1996), and it continues to be
deliberated between the major camps (i.e., daily hassles and
stressful life events proponents) of stress researchers and
can by no means be solved within the limits of this study.
For all practical purposes, and consistent with the work of
Lazarus and his colleagues (on which this study is in part
based), not having experienced an event results in a stress
score of 0 and is viewed within the realm of a scoring
continuum of 0 to 4 (see Daily Hassles Scale [Revised] by
Holm & Holroyd, 1992; Ways of Coping Scale by Lazarus
& Folkman, 1984).
The current findings suggest that the IRRS is a reliable
and valid measure of the multidimensional aspects of race-
related stress that African Americans potentially experience
in their daily lives. The IRRS can be used in assessing the
impact of racism and discrimination on the psychological
well-being of African American clients. Those providing
counseling services to this population can use the IRRS in
determining the need to address issues related to the client's
experience with racism and discrimination. In addition, the
IRRS can be further studied for possible adaptation as a
semistructured clinical interview protocol that can be used
qualitatively by counseling psychologists in serving an Af-
rican American population. The research utility of the IRRS
is limitless and includes such topical areas as examining the
therapy outcomes for African American clients, the impact
of racism on the racial identity development of African
Americans, racism and its relation to the life satisfaction of
African Americans, and the impact of racism on vocational
choices and academic outcomes.

WOMEN'S HEALTH IN THE MIDDLE YEARS
Postal Questionnaire 2003
This short postal questionnaire is for everyone and we would appreciate you taking a few minutes to complete it.
In order to continue our research on health and the menopause it is important that all women complete this
questionnaire whether or not they have reached menopause or used hormone replacement therapy (HRT). When
we last contacted women study members, one in eight were still perimenopausal and one in twenty remained
premenopausal. In addition, many will have taken hormone replacement therapy since the last questionnaire and
some will have had an operation to remove the uterus or ovaries. Thus this questionnaire updates menstrual,
surgical and HRT histories. If there is little or nothing to report this will involve only a few questions but we
still need to have the information to conduct our research.
We are delighted that so many women in the study complete the postal questionnaires. This has allowed us to
publish widely on health topics of importance to women at midlife, including lifetime influences on timing of
perimenopause and menopause, common symptoms and health care, breast cancer, and body dissatisfaction.
Recent work is summarised on the birthday card and in our list of new publications. We are now incorporating
this information on the menopause into our studies of earlier biological risk and lifetime social circumstances in
relation to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health and other measures of function.
When completing the questionnaire please use a pen to circle the appropriate response to each question and
provide further details where requested. Please feel free to add any further explanations or comments that will
help us to understand your particular experiences.
All information you give us will be treated in the strictest confidence. If you have any queries please do not
hesitate to telephone Diana Kuh or Rebecca Hardy on 020 7679 1720 or write to us at the above address.
When you have finished filling in the questionnaire please use the pre-paid envelope provided to post it back to
us. Thank you very much for your time and cooperation.

Class Groupings
We are interested to know about groupings between and within classes in this child's year. Q46-Q54 ask about
groupings between classes and Q55-Q63 ask about groupings within classes.
Some schools group children in the same year by general ability and they are taught in these groups for most or
all lessons. We refer to this as streaming.
Some schools group children from different classes by ability for certain subjects only and they may be taught in
different ability groups for different subjects. We refer to this as setting.
Other schools do not group children by ability between classes. Sometimes this may be because there are not
multiple classes in the year.

Some schools group children within the same class by general ability and they are taught in these ability groups
for most or all lessons. We refer to this as within-class ability grouping.
Some schools group children within the same class by ability for certain subjects only and they may be taught in
different ability groups for different subjects. We refer to this as within-class subject grouping.
Other schools do not group children by ability within classes. Some schools may use within-class groupings in
addition to between class streaming and setting and others may use within-class groupings instead of between
class streaming and setting.
Some schools may not use any general or subject specific ability groupings either within or between classes.

Now we'd like to learn about your BABY and what s/he likes and dislikes.
☺   All babies are different so we would like to learn from you   ☺
a little more about your experience of your own baby so far ....
As you read about each baby behaviour on the next page, please tell us how often YOUR BABY did this during the
LAST WEEK (the past seven days) by circling one of the numbers in the right hand column.
The "Does Not Apply" (X) column is used when you did not see the
baby in the situation described during the last week. For example, if the
situation mentions the baby having to wait for food or liquids and there
was no time during the last week when the baby had to wait, circle the
(X) column. "Does Not Apply" is different from "Never" (1).
"Never" (1) is used when you saw the baby in the situation but the baby
never engaged in the behavior listed during the last week.  For example,
if the baby did have to wait for food or liquids at least once but never
cried loudly while waiting, circle the (1) column.

HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY YOUR MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TO RECEIVE IT.
Approach to the Mother.
Remind her that she was visited soon after her baby was born in March, 1946. We now want to find out what progress
her baby has made. By giving as many details as she can, she will be helping us to plan better health services. All information
she gives will, of course, be treated as ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL.
How to fill in this Form.
This inquiry refers throughout to THE BABY BORN IN MARCH, 1946.
3h
2. Before you interview the mother read through the questionnaire and answer as many questions as possible from your
records and those of the Infant Welfare Centre. Check with the mother, when you interview her, all the answers you
have obtained from the records.
3. The questions are printed in heavy type and the mother's answers in light type. Instructions to the interviewer are in
italics. i
4. The answers to the questions are shown by putting a ring with a soft pencil round the code number or letter opposite the j
mother's answer. If the answer does not fit any alternative write it below the question itself. If a mother refuses or is
unable to answer any question put a ring round " X"' or "' XX"' for '' No answer."
5. Please follow the order of the questions as set out in the questionnaire and keep as close to the phrasing as you can. When
any question does not apply to a particular mother or baby ring the code number " Y"' or "' YY '' for "' does not apply."
Do not strike through a question or leave it blank. EVERY QUESTION SHOULD BE ANSWERED. Before leaving
the mother please check through the questionnaire to see that this has been done.
6. Some of the questions on illness are in tabular form. Deal with each illness in turn and record the answer to each question
by putting a ring round the appropriate code number in the column referring to the illness with which you are dealing.
7. The comments on home conditions at the end of this questionnaire should be filled in from your own knowledge and
observation of the household. Do NOT ask the mother these questions.
8. If a baby has died please try to obtain all the details you can about his health and development up to the date of death.
It is just as essential to obtain information about a baby who has died as about one who is alive. However, use your
judgment in leaving out any question that might cause embarrassment.
9. Ifthe mother refuses to be interviewed try to find out her reasons and write them in the space provided. Then fill in as much
of the questionnaire as you can from the records, and RETURN THE FORM WITH THE OTHERS YOU HAVE COM-
PLETED.
10. When you have completed your interviews, hand the questionnaires to whoever has been delegated by your Medical Officer
of Health to receive them.

What is the National Drug Strategy Household
Survey?
• The 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey
collects information on tobacco, alcohol and other
drug use, attitudes and beliefs.
• The survey is conducted about every three years
and started in 1985.
• It is managed by the Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare (AIHW) on behalf of the Australian
Government Department of Health.
How confidential is the information I give you?
• All answers you provide will be treated
confidentially.
• The research is carried out in compliance with the
Privacy Act 1988 and the information is only used for
research purposes.
• The survey is conducted under the AIHW Act 1987,
which prohibits the release of information about
individuals collected in the survey.
How will my answers be used?
• Your answers will be used by researchers to help in
understanding what people think about tobacco,
alcohol and other drugs and how widely these drugs
are used.
• The answers you give will not be released to anyone
(including the police).
Do I have to participate in the survey?
• Participation in this survey is entirely voluntary.
• If there are any questions you do not want to answer
for any reason, please leave that question blank.
• It is important that you complete this questionnaire
by yourself and be as honest and accurate as
possible.
2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey
Are you 12 – 17 years old?
• It is important that our younger respondents know
that your answers will not be shown to anyone,
this includes your parents.
• Please don't be afraid or embarrassed to give honest
answers.
• Your answers will simply become part of a bigger
pool of answers and no one will know who you are.
What do I do when I've completed the survey?
• Once you have completed the survey, seal it in the
envelope provided and a Roy Morgan Research
fieldworker will return to collect it.
• The fieldworker will then return the sealed envelope
to the survey team for processing.
• Only the survey team will have access to your form
and once the survey data is compiled your form will
be destroyed.
• Your name and address will never be linked with any
of the information you provide.
How is the information processed?
• All survey forms are coded so the researchers will
not know who you are. Your answers will be grouped
with the answers of over 22,000 other people before
the researchers get to see them.
• Researchers will use all these answers to show
things like 'most young people do not smoke' or
'three quarters of women drink alcohol'.
• When released in late-2017, the results of the survey
will be available on the Institute's website
(www.aihw.gov.au).

Statistical Linkage Key
Please read this:
With your permission, we would like to collect some information from you so that your data from this survey and
your data from other government records may be linked (i.e. combined) – but kept completely confidential.
This data linking would only be for research purposes.
This linking would be done by using a 'Statistical Linkage Key', which is simply a group of letters and numbers
that contains enough information to link records for statistical analysis, but cannot be used to identify anyone.
Answering this section is optional and entirely voluntary.  It is also completely confidential.  For more detail on
confidentiality please see the information below.
To answer this section, please go to the next page.
Remember - Your confidentiality and privacy are protected
• Your actual name and other personal details will NOT be used at all in the linking of your survey data to
other government records.
• No information from this survey will ever be added to any of your other government records.
• The linking of this data will only ever be used for statistical purposes. It will never be used for any legal,
administrative or other purposes.
• Statistical reports will only contain combined information from many people and will not identify any
individual.
• All your responses are treated confidentially. The research is carried out in compliance with the Privacy
Act 1988 and the information is used for research purposes only.
• The AIHW has specific legislation (Section 29 of the AIHW Act 1987) which prevents identifiable
information about you from being released to anyone.
How to complete this:
To create the Statistical Linkage Key, we need a few specific letters from both your first name and your
surname.  Please print ONLY these letters in the boxes on the next page: the 2nd and 3rd letters of your first or
given name, and the 2nd, 3rd and 5th letters of your surname (family name).
EXAMPLE ONLY:

What is data linkage?
Data linkage refers to the bringing together of information from more than one source that relates to the same
person. This allows researchers to tell a bigger story than analysing data from just one source. For example,
comparing the data on women who received the HPV vaccination with data on women who developed cervical
cancer provided strong evidence that overall, the vaccination was effective in reducing cervical cancer.

EXAMINATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.
Introduction
Most, Dut not all, of the cohort and their parents have already participated in this Study, either in the Perinatal period
intermediately, or at five or ten years.
At five and ten years, health visitors of your DHA caried out an extensive review of the health, development and pre.
school care.
At ten years we were able, through your DHA, to identify members of the cohort who had health problems, disabilities
and handicaps. Health Visitors and Community Medical Officers kindly conducted interviews and examinations.
Parents of the teenagers have this time received a letter explaining the 16 year Study, inviting their co-operation and
ensuring therm of confidentiality.
This time some of the mothers will already have been interviewed at home by a health visitor/school nurse; for the
remainder, the home interview could be done subsequently, or accomplished at the same time as the medical
examination provided that the mother aqrees to attend at that time. The documents needed for the maternat inte:view
consist of The Parental Interview Form (Document O), The Maternal Self-Completion Form (Document P) and The
Teenage Leisure Diary (Document S). For the medical examination the following documents are needed (i) The Medical
Examination Form (Document R), (ii) The Teenage Health Self-Completion Questionnaire, which should be completed
by the teenager at the time of attendance for the medical examination (iii) The Information Manual for Headlitt Personnel
(Document N)), includes the necessary instructions and contains a Sheridan-Gardiner Near Vision sheet for testing near
vision.
Your Local Education Authority has kindly traced the whereabouts of the cohort tn your OHA and has arranged a
separate school educational assessment of each teenager, including lests of reading, vocabulary. mathematics,
matrices and spelling; from this, it will be possible to identify slow learners and teenagers with educational as well as
health problems.
THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION FORM IS IN THREE SECTIONS
Section 1. (A) Use of Service, (B) Disabilities (pages 3 and 4)
in order to complete this section fully, you will need to assemble all the teenager's school medical records and all other
relevant school health and educational documents. You are asked to pay particular attention to assembling complete
records of any teenager who is handicapped, receiving special education, or who has been assessed for special
educational needs. You will be asked to provide a summary from the notes of the progress and current status of each
such teenager. Even if only partial records are accessible to you, please complete all Sections of this questionnaire as
far as possible at the time of the medical examination.
Section 2. (A) Morbidity and Special Senses, (B) Medical Examination (pages 4-9)
Please make sure that the recommended equipment is available. Please read in advance if you have time, the medical
history from the Parental interview Form if already completed. Please read through the medical questions carefully
before the examination. If you have time, please try out the co-ordination tests. The medical examination is structured
to provide the maximum information while leaving you free to conduct the clinical examnation in any way you find
optimal. Tests such as distant and near vision and measurements of height, weight, head circumference and blood
pressure have been aggregated in the medical examination form, in case it proves expedient to carry these out just prior
to the actual clinical examination. Please feel free to undertake the necessary measurements, in the order which best
suits the facilities available to you and anyone helping you with the examination.
Section 3: Medical Summary. This is self-explanatory (pages 10 and 11)
Section 4: The Audiogram (page 12)
An Audiogram form is on the last sheet of the examination form. It is presumed that this will be done by sweep
audiometry. The form also contains space in case pure-tone audiometry is used. You are asked to record whether the
results of sweep audiometry are normal or abnormal! and if sweep results are abnormal, to arrange to let us have details
of pure-tone audiometry. In instance where sweep audiometry is impossible to arrange, or is delayed unavoidably,the
remainder of completed health documents should be sent on to us in advance of the audiogram.

Recommended technique:
Please position the teenager upright against a flat wall or a door. Encourage him/her to stretch to full height.
keeping heels on the fioor. Heels and buttocks should be flush against wall or door. Place a hardboard/book on the
teenager's head. Mark the position of the lower edge with a pencil and then measure the height from the ground
with a wood or steel measuring rod or steel tape measure. Alternatively, use measuring device on the back of a
weighing machine and observe precautions as above. NB. Remove shoes before height is measured.

D5. BLOOD PRESSURE
Please postpone to fater in examination tf you feel teenager is nervous.
Sphygmomanometer cuff must have bladder long enough to encircle the arm completely and be wide
enough to cover two-thirds of the length of the upper arm. The cuff should preferably be at least 5 inches deep.
(vis realised that you will be experienced in taking blood pressures, but we ask you to follow the instructions
closely for uniformity: —
Sit subject on chair in as relaxed a state as possible. Wrap the cuff around the right upper arm, placing the rubber tubes
from the bladder posteriorly for ease of access to right Antecubital fossa. Paipate the right radial pulse and inflate the cuff
to about 30mm.Hg. above the disappearance of the pulse. Slowly deflate till the pulse reappears. Deflate the cuff.
Place the stethoscope in the antecubital fossa over the brachial artery,
but not in contact with any part of the cuff. Rapidly
inflate the cuff to about 30mm.Hg. above the systolic pressure and then deflate at a rate of 2-3mm.Hg. per second.
The appearance of faint clear tapping sounds for 2 consecutive beats should be recorded as the Systolic Pressure.
Continue to deflate the cuff and the sounds will soften or may become swishing, then sharper sounds will reappear. With
continuing deflation, there will be a sudden muffling of sounds. which will become soft and blowing. This is Korotkoff's
4th sound and represents the Diastolic Pressure. Do not wait until the point of complete disappearance of sounds.

E. MOTOR COORDINATION TESTS
The following four tests will identify a clumsy or inco-ordinate subject as far as this is possible on clinical examination,
Such tests are non-specific and difficult to validate. but will be used in conjunction with other findings and the Opinions
of teachers and parents, recorded elsewhere. The results will inevitably be influenced by the effects of subject's skill
and experience. At the end of the tests the examiner is asked to give a considered opinion as to the degree of
clumsiness or inco-ordination.
Please test all Youthscan teenagers except those who are grossly handicapped or those who are incapable of under-
standing the test(s). In these instances, please enter the reason after question E4.
E1. THROWING A BALLIN THE AIR
You will need a tennis ball. or a rubber bail of equivalent size and weight.
The important point about this test is to discover the subject's optimum performance. We would therefore he
grateful if you would carry out the testin the following way:
Ask the subject to stand in a space so that he/she has room to mave. Say 'Il want you to show me if you can throw
the ball up in the air and catch it'. Allow two or three initial attempts. If the subject fails to catch the ball, record
the fact and do not proceed with the test.
If the subject can catch the ball, say 'Now throw the ball up in the air and clap your hands together once before
you catch it." Then repeat the procedure increasing the number of claps until the subject fails on two successive
attempts. Record the greatest number of claps resulting in a successful catch.
If the greatest number of claps was 2 or more, ask him/her to repeat the test. catching with one hand only. Let
him/her use preferred hand

E2. FIGURE DRAWING ON PALM OF HAND: (GRAPHESTHESIA)
You will need a blunt point, for example a biro with tip retracted. O x  3
Ask the subject to place both his/her hands ona table, palms uppermost. Using the blunt point, firmly describe a
figure 8 on the subject's right palm. Take two seconds to draw it, and allow the subject to watch. Ask him/her
what you have drawn.

Find a straight line on the floor at least 4 metres tong, e.g. the groove of 2 floorboard, or mark one out with chalk
Use a corridor if the examination room is not long enough.
Ask the subject to put his/her hands on hips and then to walk backwards along the line, placing one foot behind
the other, toe-to-heel.
First demonstrate the test, saying 'I want you to walk like this. Remember your toes must touch your heel with
each step you take. Keep your hands on your hips. Walk backwards in a straight line. You may glance behind you
if it helps'.
Let the subject have two practices by asking him/her to walk backwards for 5 steps on each occasion.
Then ask the subject to walk backwards for 20 steps. Count the number of steps made before any error occurs.
An error occurs if the subject ceases to maintain toe-to heel or deviates from the line or moves either hand from
hips. If an error is made in the first 5 steps, continue to count the number of steps until the next error.

This would indicate xx hours sitting or on your feet.
2.2 Of those hours how many on a typical day do you spend sitting
down?  (e.g. includes sitting at work, mealtimes,
driving, reading, watching TV)
hrs      mins
2.3 This would mean that you spend about xx hours a day on your feet.  Does this sound
about right?

Here are some questions about family life. Do you personally agree or disagree...
A pre-school child is likely to suffer if his or
her mother works
All in all, family life suffers when the woman
has a full-time job
Employers should make special arrangements
to help mothers combine jobs and childcare
Both the husband and wife should contribute
to the household income
A husband's job is to earn money; a wife's job
is to look after the home and family
Thank you very much for taking the time to answer our questions.

MY    DAUGHTER
This questionnaire asks about your baby. We are interested to know about
her health and behaviour. We also ask about you and your baby and the
reaction of any other children you might have to the baby. Your answers
will help us to understand the developing child and identify problems
that babies and their parents have.
The questionnaire is like other questionnaires you have received. To
answer simply tick the box which best describes your baby or your
baby's situation. Some questions will seem similar but they are not the
same. Please answer all questions that you can. If you cannot answer
any question or a question does not apply to you please put a line
through them. There are no right or wrong answers. Please just describe
what happens in your situation. You may make additional comments at the
end.
All answers are confidential.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

Most of the questions can be answered by ticking the box beside the right answer.
For example
How many times have you been to the supermarket in the past week?
None 1 1�  2 2-63 7 or more 4
This means you went to the supermarket once in the past week
Sometimes there are questions with if in front of them.
For example
a) Have you been to the supermarket today?
Yes 1 No �  2
This means you didn't go to the supermarket and you don't
need to answer the next question
b) If yes, did you buy any carrots?
Yes 1 No  2
In general, though, each question needs an answer.
In some questions you may be asked to describe something.
It would be helpful if you wrote as clearly as possible.
The small numbers in the squares are for only.

JANUARY 1961 s. 8b
NATIONAL SURVEY OF THE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN
79 Wimpole Street, London, W.1.
Under the joint auspices of
Institute of Child Health (University of London); Society National Foundation for Educational Research in
of Medical Officers of Health; Population Investigation England and Wales.
Committee.
The Scottish Council for Research in Education.
QUESTIONNAIRE FOR HEADMASTERS AND HEADMISTRESSES OF SCHOOLS
ATTENDED BY SURVEY CHILDREN
EXPLANATORY NOTE
The children enrolled in this Survey were born in March 1946 and with the help of their parents, health visitors,
school nurses and teachers a detailed account has been obtained of their health and development during the past 15
years. The children come from all types of home and are attending all types of school, both Independent and Local
Authority. They are now reaching the age when many of them will be leaving school and the Joint Committee feels
some uniform assessment of their progress together with background information about the secondary schools they have
been attending is most desirable. During the past 15 years only 10 per cent of the children have been lost and the
value of this inquiry depends on our continuing to obtain information for every possible survey child.
HOW TO FILL IN THIS FORM
There may be more than one survey child in your school, but since this form contains only general questions
relating to the school it will only be necessary for you to fill in one of these forms (S.8b). But it is essential that you
enter on this form the full names and reference numbers of all the survey children concerned. These will be found
on the accompanying test booklets (Forms N.F.4) and should be copied from there. When you have filled in this form
please return it, together with the test booklets (Forms N.F.4) and Teacher's Questionnaires (Forms S. 8a), to the
Director of Education.
All information given will be regarded as strictly confidential and there is no possibility that the name of any child
or school will appear in any report.

Self Report Measures for Love and Compassion Research: Loneliness and Interpersonal Problems
UCLA LONELINESS SCALE
Reference:
Russell, D , Peplau, L. A.. & Ferguson, M. L. (1978). Developing a measure of loneliness.
Journal  of Personality Assessment, 42, 290-294.
Description of Measure:
A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as
feelings of social isolation.  Participants rate each item as either O ("I often feel this way"),
S ("I sometimes feel this way"), R ("I rarely feel this way"), N ("I never feel this way").
The measure has been revised two times since its first publication; once to create
reverse scored items, and once to simplify the wording.  (See other UCLA Loneliness Scale
pages on the site).
Abstracts of Selected Related Articles:
Russell, D , Peplau, L. A.., & Cutrona, C. E. (1980). The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale:
Concurrent and discriminate validity evidence. Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology, 39, 472-480.
The development of an adequate assessment instrument is a necessary prerequisite for
social psychological research on loneliness. Two studies provide methodological
refinement in the measurement of loneliness. Study 1 presents a revised version of the
self-report UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Loneliness Scale, designed to
counter the possible effects of response bias in the original scale, and reports concurrent
validity evidence for the revised measure. Study 2 demonstrates that although
loneliness is correlated with measures of negative affect, social risk taking, and
affiliative tendencies, it is nonetheless a distinct psychological experience.
Russell, D. (1996). UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3): Reliability, validity, and factor
structure. Journal of Personality Assessment, 66, 20-40.
In this article I evaluated the psychometric properties of the UCLA Loneliness Scale
(Version 3). Using data from prior studies of college students: nurses, teachers, and the
elderly, analyses of the reliability, validity, and factor structure of this new version of
the UCLA Loneliness Scale were conducted. Results indicated that the measure was
highly reliable, both in terms of internal consistency (coefficient a ranging from .89 to
.94) and test-retest reliability over a 1-year period (r = .73). Convergent validity for the
scale was indicated by significant correlations with other measures of loneliness.
Construct validity was supported by significant relations with measures of the adequacy
of the individual's interpersonal relationships, and by correlations between loneliness
and measures of health and well-being. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a
model incorporating a global bipolar loneliness factor along with two method factors
reflecting direction of item wording provided a very good fit to the data across samples.
Implications of these results for future measurement research on loneliness are
discussed.
Self Report Measures for Love and Compassion Research: Loneliness and Interpersonal Problems
Weeks, D. G., Michela, J. L., Peplau, L. A., & Bragg, M. E. (1980). Relation between
loneliness and depression: A structural equation analysis. Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology, 39,1238-1244
Research on loneliness has been hampered by its strong association with depression.
The 2 states frequently co-occur, and measures of the 2 states are substantially
correlated. Inability to manipulate experimentally loneliness or depression makes it
difficult to untangle the causal influence of one on the other. The combination of
longitudinal design and structural equation methodology is proposed as a solution to
this general problem. Measures of loneliness and depression (e.g., the Beck Depression
Inventory and Profile of Mood States) were administered to undergraduates at 2 points
5 wks apart. Data from 333 Ss were correlated and analyzed under a succession of
structural equation models. Results indicate that loneliness and depression were
correlated but clearly different constructs; neither was a direct cause of the other,
although both probably share some common origins; both were highly stable over the 5-
wk period.

Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) – Instructions for Use
The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire is designed for use in adults, i.e. patients
over the age of 16.  It is self-explanatory and can be simply handed to the patient who is asked
to fill it in without the need for detailed explanation.  It is usually completed in one to two
minutes.
SCORING
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much      scored 3
A lot       scored 2
A little      scored 1
Not at all      scored 0
Not relevant      scored 0
Question 7, "prevented work or studying" scored 3
The DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30.  The
higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.
HOW TO INTERPRET MEANING OF DLQI SCORES
0 – 1  no effect at all on patient's life
2 – 5  small effect on patient's life
6 – 10  moderate effect on patient's life

YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
These questions are about you and your friends. As you know,
friendships are very important - for happiness, for health and
for getting on in the world. But researchers really don't know
much about how friendships are formed. That's where you
come in!! These questions are designed to help us understand
who makes friends with who, and what friends do together.
As usual with Children of the 90s questions, all of your
answers are completely private and no-one else will know who
you've named as friends. We know that this is important to
you, so it's worth repeating: no young person or parent from
the Children of the 90s and no-one working with the data will
ever see the names you put down.

There are some questions about each best friend that you nominate. You can
nominate 5 friends, or less, if you want to. Don't include brothers and sisters
in here, but you can include boyfriends or girlfriends. You don't need to worry
about the order you write them down in. The researchers will take the people
as just five best friends - they won't assume that the one you write down first
is your best best friend. When you are finished filling in the details on your
friends, please go to Page 24 for a few final questions.

2 FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE

the amount of food eaten.  You should only include food actually eaten, do not include food that was left over or spilled.  For some foods, I will show
you drawings and models to help you estimate the amount of food.  Your baby may sometimes be fed by a relative, friend or someone else.  If you
know the type of food and approximate amount eaten at these times please include them.  Explain the use of spoons, cups, bowl and diagrams.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
We would like to assess the stage of your physical development using the drawings
on the next pages. These show various stages commonly used by doctors to assess
the growth and development of girls.
We need to know which drawings most closely match
your stage of development at the moment.
Not all teenagers follow the same pattern of development.
Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.

The nipple is raised a little in
this stage. The rest of the
breast is still flat.
This is the breast bud stage. In this
stage the nipple is raised more than in
stage 1. The breast is a small mound.
The dark area around the nipple
(areola) is larger than in stage 1.
The areola and the breast are both
larger than in stage 2. The areola does
not stick out away from the breast
The areola and the nipple make up a
mound that sticks up above the shape
of the breast. (Note: This stage may not
happen at all for some teenagers. Some
teenagers develop from stage 3 to stage
5 with no stage 4.)
This is the mature adult stage. The
breasts are fully developed. Only the
nipple sticks out in this stage. The
areola has moved back in the general
shape of the breast.
Section B
The drawings below show stages of the way the breasts develop. A teenager can
go through each of the five stages shown, although some teenagers skip some
stages. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read the
descriptions.
Cross the box that is closest to your current breast stage

Section C
The drawings below show different amounts of female pubic hair. A
teenager can go through each of the five stages shown. Please look at
each of the drawings. It is also important to read the descriptions.
Cross the box that is the closest to the amount of pubic hair you have.
There is no pubic hair
There is a little long, lightly coloured hair.
This hair may be straight or a little curly.
The hair is darker in this stage. It is coarser
and more curled. It has spread out and thinly
covers a bigger area.
The hair is now as dark, curly, and coarse as
that of an adult woman. However, the area
that the hair covers is not as large as that of
an adult woman. The hair has not spread out
to the legs.
The hair now is like that of an adult woman.
It also covers the same area as that of an
adult woman. The hair usually forms a
triangular pattern as it spreads out to the
legs.
NOTE: Your pubic hair stage may or may not be the same as
your stage of breast development.

Further information on the Malaise Inventory
The Malaise Inventory is comprised of 24 self-completion items covering emotional and somatic
symptoms and is intended to measure psychological distress (Rutter, 1970). The Malaise Inventory
was derived from the Cornell Medical Index Health Questionnaire, which was comprised of 195 self-
completion items (Brodman et al., 1949). Each item in the Malaise Inventory has the response
options yes or no.
How are you feeling generally...
1. Do you often have backache?
2. Do you feel tired most of the time?
3. Do you often feel miserable or depressed?
4. Do you often have bad headaches?
5. Do you often get worried about things?
6. Do you usually have great difficulty in falling or staying asleep?
7. Do you usually wake unnecessarily early in the morning?
8. Do you wear yourself out worrying about your health?
9. Do you often get in a violent rage?
10. Do people often annoy and irritate you?
11. Have you at times had twitching of the face, head or shoulders?
12. Do you often suddenly become scared for no good reason?
13. Are you scared to be alone when there are no friends near you?
14. Are you easily upset or irritated?
15. Are you frightened of going out alone or of meeting people?
16. Are you constantly keyed up and jittery?
17. Do you suffer from indigestion?
18. Do you suffer from an upset stomach?
19. Is your appetite poor?
20. Does every little thing get on your nerves and wear you out?
21. Does your heart often race like mad?
22. Do you often have bad pains in your eyes?
23. Are you troubled with rheumatism or fibrositis?
24. Have you ever had a nervous breakdown?
The Malaise Inventory has a good level of internal consistency and its validity is robust across
different population groups (Rodgers et al., 1999). Consequently it has been widely used in
population studies.

Assessing Alcohol Problems: A Guide for Clinicians and Researchers
ALCOHOL CRAVING QUESTIONNAIRE — SHORT FORM-REVISED (ACQ—SF-R)
SCORING KEY
CONTENT VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY. The Alcohol Craving Questionnaire—Short Form (ACQ—SE-R: Singleton,
1997) contains 12-items from the 47-item Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ-NOW) developed to assess craving
for alcohol among alcohol users in the current context (right now). Items were derived from the initial validation
study (Singleton et al., 1996) of the ACQ-NOW administered to 219 subjects who had used alcohol at least once
in the last 30 days. The ACQ—SE-R contains 12 items strongly correlated with the four subscales and total ACQ
(Tiffany et al., 2000). .
Factor naming is consistent with the ACQ-NOW (Drobes et al., 1999; Potgeiter et al., 1999; Singleton et al., 1998).
The following item sets provide subscales that approximate each factor. Each item has seven compartments that are
checked-off and are scored in the fashion of 1-7 to yield an item raw score. Then perform the operation (8- reverse-
keyed item raw score = raw score) for reverse-keyed items (marked with an *). Then sum the raw scores for each factor
and divide by three (3) to yield a factor-based score. A general craving index may be derived by summing all items
(total ACQ score) and dividing by 12 (the number of items with significant loadings).
FACTOR i
Compulsivity (COMP), urges and desires in anticipation of loss of control over drinking - 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 4 (.46), 5 (.63), 6 (.51)
RELIABILITY*: .79
FACTOR 2
Expectancy (XPCT), urges and desires to drink in anticipation of the positive benefits of drinking - 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 1 (.44), 2 (.37), 12 (.43)
RELIABILITY: .77
FACTOR 3
Purposefulness (PURP), urges and desires coupled with intent and planning to drink ~ 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 3* (.57), 8* (.68), 11* (.68)
RELIABILITY: .77
FACTOR 4
Emotionality (EMOT), urges and desires to drink in anticipation of relief from withdrawal/negative affect - 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 7 (.41), 9 (.47), 10 (.45)
RELIABILITY: .86
a Reliability value is estimated standardized alpha coefficient.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: This research was supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intramural

he/she was still attending school or college full-time. Since that time he/she has left school or
college, and in order to have accurate knowledge of the job histories, up to their eighteenth

asked to obtain information for these late school-leavers in a similar manner to their follow-up of
the young people they have previously interviewed on behalf of the Survey.
Please complete Question 1 with all jobs, periods of unemployment or sickness from the date
of leaving full-time education up to 9 March 1964. The method of obtaining this information is left

be possible to ensure the record is complete. In a similar way, Question 2 refers to part-time
education.
When you have completed this form, please return it to your Regional Representative (via
County or County Borough YEOs where appropriate).
If the youngster has moved, but his address remains inside your area, please insert the new
address in ink at the top of the page.
If the new address is outside your area, please complete the form as far as you can from your
own information, and return the form immediately to your County YEO or Regional Representative
for re-allocation.
If the youngster is living temporarily away from home, and the home YEO cannot provide a
complete record, please pencil in the temporary address at the top of the form, and return it for
re-allocation to your County YEO or Regional Representative, as appropriate.

LOOKING   AFTER   THE   BABY
This questionnaire is for the person who is mostly responsible for
looking after the study baby.
It asks about your lifestyle as your baby is getting older. Your answers
will help us understand what problems babies and their mothers have at
this stage.
The questionnaire asks you to answer a number of questions and give your
opinion about some ideas about caring for a baby. To answer simply
tick the box which is most accurate in your opinion.
Some questions may seem similar, but they are not the same. Others will
be the same as you have answered in earlier questionnaires. This is so
that we can see how things may have changed for you.
Please answer all questions if you can even if they are similar. There
are no right or wrong answers. Just tell us what you really think. All
answers are confidential.
When you have finished you may make comments at the end.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP

Scoring for LupusPRO v1.7
The LupusPRO© has 5 point Likert response format, where 0=None of the time/not applicable, 1= A little of the
time, 2= Some of the time, 3=Most of the time, 4= All of the time, 5= Not applicable (recode as 0 for scoring).
Reverse scoring for some items is required (as above). There are 12 observed domains. Item scores are totaled for
each domain item and the mean domain score is obtained by dividing the total score by the number of items in that
domain. The mean raw domain score is transformed to scores ranging from 0 (worst QOL) to 100 (best QOL) by
dividing by 4 (the number of Likert responses (5 responses) minus 1) and then multiplying by 100, as below:
(Mean raw domain score/4) x 100= Transformed score for the domain.
Transformed domain scores are obtainable when at least 50% of the items are answered. Total HRQOL and N-
HRQOL scores are obtained by averaging the transformed domain scores within each construct.

Scoring the Oswestry Disability Index
No disability
The patient can cope with most living activities. Usually no treatment is indicated apart from advice on
lifting, sitting and exercise.
Mild disability
The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and standing. Travel and social life
are more difficult and they may be disabled from work. Personal care, sexual activity and sleeping are not
grossly affected and the patient can usually be managed by conservative means.
Moderate disability
Pain remains the main problem in this group but activities of  daily living are affected. These patients
require a detailed investigation.
Severe disability
Back pain impinges on all aspects of  the patient's life. Positive intervention is required.
Completely disabled
These patients are either bed-bound or are exaggerating their symptoms.
WHY BOTHER WITH AN OUTCOMES MEASURE?
As physical therapy works towards autonomous practice and incorporating evidence-based medicine into
it's practice, it is imperative that therapists utilize measuring tools which have been validated through
research.
Insurance companies and physicians are very familiar with these instruments and are asking for scores
such as Oswestry.

The Oswestry Disability Index (aka the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) is an ex-
tremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent
functional disability. The test has been around since 1980 and is considered the 'gold standard' of  low
back pain functional outcome tools.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
We would like to assess the stage of your daughter's physical development using the
drawings on the next pages. These indicate various stages of puberty commonly used by
doctors to assess the growth and development of girls.
We need to know which drawings most closely match
your daughter's stage of development at the moment.
Not all children follow the same pattern of development.
Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.
If there are any additional comments about your daughter's physical growth and development
that you would like to make, then please do so here:

SECTION B
The drawings below show stages of the way the breasts develop. A girl can go through each
of the five stages shown, although some girls skip some stages. Please look at each of the
drawings. It is also important to read the descriptions.
Put a tick in the box to the right of the drawing that is closest to your daughter's current
breast stage.
This is the breast bud stage. In this stage the
nipple is raised more than in stage 1. The
breast is a small mound. The dark area
around the nipple (areola) is larger than in
stage 1.
The areola and the breast are both larger
than in stage 2. The areola does not stick
out away from the breast.
The areola and the nipple make up a mound
that sticks up above the shape of the breast.
(Note: This stage may not happen at all for
some girls. Some girls develop from stage 3
to stage 5 with no stage 4.)
This is the mature adult stage. The breasts
are fully developed. Only the nipple sticks
out in this stage. The areola has moved
back in the general shape of the breast.

The nipple is raised a little in this
stage. The rest of the breast is still flat.

SECTION C
The drawings below show different amounts of female pubic hair. A girl can go through
each of the five stages shown. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read
the descriptions.
Put a tick in the box to the right of the drawing that is the closest to the amount of pubic hair
your daughter has.
Not sure
NOTE: Your daughter's pubic hair stage may or may not be the same as her stage of
breast development.
There is no pubic hair
There is a little long, lightly coloured hair. This
hair may be straight or a little curly.
The hair is darker in this stage. It is coarser and
more curled. It has spread out and thinly covers a
bigger area.
The hair is now as dark, curly, and coarse as that
of an adult woman. However, the area that the
hair covers is not as large as that of an adult
woman. The hair has not spread out to the legs.
The hair now is like that of an adult woman. It
also covers the same area as that of an adult
woman. The hair usually forms a triangular
pattern as it spreads out to the legs.

The APA is offering a number of "emerging measures" for further research and
clinical evaluation. These patient assessment measures were developed to be
administered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.
They should be used in research and evaluation as potentially useful tools to
enhance clinical decision-making and not as the sole basis for making a clinical
diagnosis. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are
provided; further background information can be found in DSM-5. The APA
requests that clinicians and researchers provide further data on the
instruments' usefulness in characterizing patient status and improving patient
care at http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Feedback-Form.aspx.
Measure: Severity Measure for Depression—Child Age 11–17 (adapted from PHQ-
9 modified for Adolescents [PHQ-A])
Rights granted: This measure can be reproduced without permission by
researchers and by clinicians for use with their patients.
Rights holder: This measure was adapted from the PHQ-9 modified for
Adolescents (PHQ-A), which is in the public domain
(http://www.phqscreeners.com/instructions/instructions.pdf). The original
measure was developed by Drs. Robert L. Spitzer, Janet B.W. Williams, Kurt
Kroenke and colleagues, with an educational grant from Pfizer Inc.
The reference for the original measure is: Johnson JG, Harris ES, Spitzer RL,

Modified from the PHQ-A (J. Johnson, 2002) for research and evaluation purposes
Instructions to Clinicians
The Severity Measure for Depression—Child Age 11–17 (adapted from PHQ-9 modified for Adolescents [PHQ-A]) is a 9-
item measure that assesses the severity of depressive disorders and episodes (or clinically significant symptoms of
depressive disorders and episodes) in children ages 11–17. The measure is completed by the child prior to a visit with
the clinician. Each item asks the child to rate the severity of his or her depression symptoms during the past 7 days.
Scoring and Interpretation
Each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=Several days; 2=More than half the days; and
3=Nearly every day). The total score can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.
The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw
score in the section provided for "Clinician Use." The raw scores on the 9 items should be summed to obtain a total raw
score and should be interpreted using the table below:
Interpretation Table of Total Raw Score
Total Raw Score Severity of depressive disorder or episode
0-4  None
5-9  Mild
10-14  Moderate
15-19
20-27
Moderately severe
Severe
Note: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total raw score on the measure should not be used.  Therefore, the
child should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure.  If 1 or 2 items are left unanswered, you are
asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing the scores of items that were
answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total number of items on the PHQ-9 modified
for Adolescents (PHQ-A)—Modified (i.e., 9) and divide the value by the number of items that were actually answered
(i.e., 7 or 8). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:
____________(Raw sum x 9)______________
Number of items that were actually answered
If the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.
Frequency of Use
To track changes in the severity of the child's depression over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals
as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child's symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high scores
on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child that might warrant further
assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.

If a child has moved to another school this form should be returned
to the Director of Education and not sent directly to the new school.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey of the health, growth and development of children. With
the help of his parents and of health visitors, school nurses and teachers, a detailed account has been obtained of
his health and development during the past 13 years. The survey children come from all types of home and are
attending all types of school both independent and Local Authority. During the past 13 years only 6 per cent have
been lost and the value of this inquiry depends on our continuing to obtain information for every possible survey child.
Some of the most valuable information obtained during the primary school period was given by the teachers,
and the present questions are modelled on those that were particularly successful in the past. A large number relate
to behaviour, and in these the object is to find out how well the child is adjusted to school and work. We are just
as interested in those who are doing very well as in those who are doing badly.
All information given will be regarded as strictly confidential and there is no possibility that the name of any child
or school will appear in any report.
CHILDREN'S QUESTIONNAIRE
You will find inside this questionnaire another one (on yellow paper) for the child himself to fill in. This should
be administered in the same way as an intelligence test; after making sure the child fully understands the instructions
get him to move rapidly through the items. When he has finished please make sure he has answered all the questions
and then return both questionnaires, folded one inside the other, to the Director of Education.

Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ)
The Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ) was adapted from the
Physiological Reactions Questionnaire developed by Derryberry and Rothbart (1988).
Based upon the results from recent studies (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000; Evans &
Rothbart, 2007) we have formulated a self-report model of temperament that includes
general constructs of effortful control, negative affect (which can be further divided into
aggressive and nonaggressive negative affects) extraversion/surgency, orienting
sensitivity, and affiliativeness.

SCORING INSTRUCTION FOR ATQ LONG FORM (249 items)

Contact David Evans at David.Evans@Moffitt.org if you have any questions or need
additional information.
For reliabilities and norms, etc., please refer to Evans and Rothbart (2007).
Scoring Instructions for Evans & Rothbart (2007) ATQ long form
Reversed (R) Items:  After the initial coding of the questionnaire, reversed items
need to be reverse coded (i.e., a response of 1=7, 2=6, 3=5, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, and 7=1).
Items that are reversed are marked with an "R" next to their item number in the listing of
items by scale.
Subscales/Subconstructs are listed in bold print.  To score the subscales, add all
of the Likert-responses within a given scale together and divide by the number of valid
item responses.
General Scales/Constructs are listed in capitalized, underlined print.  To score
general scales for the long form, add the AVERAGE Likert score from each subscale and
then divide by the total number of items belonging to that scale.
Item clusters are used to further differentiate the content of subscales and are
listed in italics.  Not all of the main-scales are divided into item clusters.  If particular
item clusters are of interest, they can be scored in the same manner as the subscales.
However, in most instances, it is likely that the main scales and/or factor scales will be
the variables of interest.

IF THE FAMILY HAS MOVED TO ANOTHER AUTHORITY PLEASE ENTER THE NEW ADDRESS AND THE NAMES OF
THE NEW L.E.A. AND NEW SCHOOL IN THE SPACE PROVIDED. IF THE CHILD CANNOT BE TRACED PLEASE ENTER
THE LAST ADDRESS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US TO TRACE HIM. 'IN EITHER CASE
RETURN THE FORM TO WHOMEVER HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER TO RECEIVE IT.
Approach to the Mother
Remind her that in previous years she gave us most valuable information about herself and her child. We now want to find out what progress
her child has made during the last year. All information she gives will, of course, be ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL.
Purpose of this inquiry
This child, was enrolled at birth in a national survey which is being made by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of
Medical Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. The purpose of the present examination is to bring the medical and social
history up to date. ¥
The children in this sample are representative of all births in England, Wales and Scotland in March 1946. They are drawn from all social
classes and during the first ten years of their lives only 8% of the original sample have been lost. The value of this inquiry depends on information
being obtained for every possible survey child. The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that this fofm should be completed.
How to fill in this form.
Five thousand Mothers scattered all over the country are being interviewed, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of Health
Visitors and School Nurses who are seeing them should record their findings in a comparable way. For this reason, and also to reduce the amount of
clerical work, this form has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one of several printed alternatives. All that is
required is to put a circle round the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings. If no alternative fits please write
the answer in the space directly under the question. Similarly, if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain your
findings, we should be most grateful for any further information you can give us.
In order to ensure that this information is obtained in the same way by the many people taking part in the survey, it is important that the wording
and order of this form should be adhered to.
COMPLETED FORMS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER AND NOT DIRECTLY TO THE JOINT
COMMITTEE.
THIS INQUIRY REFERS THROUGHOUT TO THE CHILD BORN IN MARCH 1946. RING THE CODE NUMBER OPPOSITE THE
MOTHER'S ANSWER. IF A QUESTION DOES NOT APPLY, STRIKE IT THROUGH.

================================================================


Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
The rating should be based on a clinical interview moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms
to more detailed ones which allow a precise rating of severity. The rater must decide whether the rating lies
on the defined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or between them (1,3,5).
It is important to remember that it is only on rare occasions that a depressed patient is encountered who
cannot be rated on the items in the scale. If definite answers cannot be elicited from the patient all relevant
clues as well as information from other sources should be used as a basis for the rating in line with
customary clinical practice.
The scale may be used for any time interval between ratings, be it weekly or otherwise but this must be
recorded.

The Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) Walking Impairment Questionnaire
Overview: Regensteiner et al developed a questionnaire for evaluating walking impairment in patients
with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This can be used to identify patients with significant impairment
and to monitor effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. The authors are from the Universities of
Colorado and Rochester.
Parameters:
(1) difficulty walking a distance during the past month
(2) difficulty walking at a certain speed during the past month
(3) symptoms associated with walking impairment
Walking Distance Degree of Difficulty Points
walking indoors (around the house) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 50 feet no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 150 feet (0.5 blocks) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 300 feet (1.0 blocks) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 600 feet (2.0 blocks) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 900 feet (3.0 blocks) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 1500 feet (5.0 blocks) or more no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking distance score =
= (20 * (points for walking indoors)) + (50 * (points for walking 50 feet)) + (150 * (points for walking 150
feet)) + (300 * (points for walking 300 feet)) + (600 * (points for walking 600 feet)) + (900 * (points for
walking 900 feet)) + (1500 * (points for walking 1500 feet))
where: each distance is walked is used as a weighting factor for the points from the degree of
difficulty.
fraction of maximal walking distance score = (walking distance score) / 6060
Walking Speed Degree of Difficulty Points
walking 1 block slowly? (about 1.5 mph) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 1 block at an average speed? (about
2.0 mph)
no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking 1 block quickly? (about 3.0 mph) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
running or jogging 1 block? (about 5.0 mph) no 3
some 2
much 1
did not do 0
walking speed score = (1.5 * (points for walking slowly)) + (2 * (points for walking at average speed)) +
(3 * (points for walking quickly)) + (5 * (points for running or jogging))
where: each speed is walked is used as a weighting factor for the points from the degree of difficulty.
fraction of maximal walking speed score = (walking speed score) / 34.5
Symptoms of Walking Impairment Degree of Difficulty Points
pain or aching in your calves? no 3
slight 2
some 1
much 0
pain or aching in your thighs? no 3
slight 2
some 1
much 0
pain stiffness or aching in your joints (knees or hips)? no 3

much 0
pain or discomfort in your chest? no 3
slight 2
some 1
much 0
weakness in one or both of your legs? no 3
slight 2
some 1
much 0
shortness of breath? no 3
slight 2
some 1
much 0
heart palpitations? no 3
slight 2
some 1
much 0
other problems? (please list) no 3
slight 2
some 1
much 0
where:
• A total symptom score was not calculated. This was the questions "were not a ranked
series."
• The data was presented as "a percentage of the maximal score possible of 4.0."
Interpretation:
• minimum walking distance score: 0
• maximum walking distance score: 34.5
• minimum walking speed score: 0
• maximum walking speed score: 6 60
• The score can be used to compare impairment before and after vascular surgery.
Performance:
• Changes in questionnaire scores correlated with some measurements of treadmill
performance.
• Retesting in an untreated control group showed similar scores after 12 weeks.

Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
Source: Roos EM, Roos HP, Lohmander LS, Ekdahl C, Beynnon BD. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis
Outcome Score (KOOS)--development of a self-administered outcome measure. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther.
1998 Aug;28(2):88-96.
The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a questionnaire designed to assess short and
long-term patient-relevant outcomes following knee injury. The KOOS is self-administered and assesses five
outcomes: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of
life. The KOOS meets basic criteria of outcome measures and can be used to evaluate the course of knee
injury and treatment outcome. KOOS is patient-administered, the format is user-friendly and it takes about 10
minutes to fill out.
Scoring instructions
The KOOS's five patient-relevant dimensions are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven
items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A
Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4
(Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.
Interpretation of scores
Scores are transformed to a 0–100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100
representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic scales and generic measures. Scores between 0
and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.

When you think of the past 12 months, have you bet more than you could
really afford to lose?
This self-assessment is based on the Canadian Problem Gambling Index.
It will help you decide if you wish to seek other forms of support or information.
When you gambled, did you go back another day to try to win back the
money you lost?
Have you borrowed money or sold anything to get money to gamble?
Have you felt that you might have a problem with gambling?
Has gambling caused you any health problems, including stress or anxiety?
Still thinking about the last 12 months, have you needed to gamble with
larger amounts of money to get the same feeling of excitement?
Have people criticized your betting or told you that you had a gambling
problem, regardless of whether or not you thought it was true?
Has your gambling caused any financial problems for you or your household?
Have you felt guilty about the way you gamble or what happens when you gamble?
Total your score. The higher your score, the greater the risk that your gambling is a problem.
Score of 0: Non-problem gambling.
Score of 1 or 2:  Low level of problems with few or no identified negative consequences.
Score of 3 to 7:  Moderate level of problems leading to some negative consequences.
Score of 8 or more: Problem gambling with negative consequences and a possible loss of
control.

DAC Assessment Tool
Design, Analyze, Communicate (DAC)
A questionnaire to support the scientific design review of clinical trial study synopses
and protocols to enhance the probability of an informative outcome
Version 2023
DAT Version 2023
2
Introduction
Clinical studies are significant investments. They are a major source of information for
go/no-go decisions, regulatory approval, health economics and outcomes research,
policy determinations, and ultimately patient access and public health benefits.
Unfortunately, too few clinical studies provide meaningfully robust answers to the
questions being addressed1. Inadequate planning of trial design, analysis and
communication can lead to erroneous or meaningless results – deemed "uninformative"
by some. "Uninformativeness" is detrimental to the research field because it wastes
scarce resources, risks rejecting medicines or strategies that could have impact, and
can erode trust between investigators and participants2.
In contrast, "informativeness is a characterization of a clinical trial that indicates the
study will achieve its recruitment, statistical power, and other design goals, resulting in
credibly answering its research questions"3.
Designing and implementing informative clinical studies requires a team of qualified
specialists. Frequently this includes, but is not limited to, principal investigators, experts
in the given disease, clinicians, biostatisticians, pharmacologists, pharmacometricians
(where the intervention is a drug or requires a dose and regimen selection), and locally
based operational experts.
The mission of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's (BMGF's) Design, Analyze,
Communicate (DAC) Program is to improve the informativeness of BMGF-funded global
health clinical studies by performing scientific design reviews, also called "DAC
Reviews."  DAC Reviews are conducted by teams of BMGF-funded clinical trial experts
in the areas listed above.  The review approach prioritizes an overall assessment of trial
informativeness, as defined by 16 validated research methods for informative clinical
trial planning, or "best practices" (see Table 1 below).  In addition, the review approach
evaluates studies for other key critical factors.  BMGF grantees that go through a DAC
Review receive written feedback about their study planning that they can use to help
finalize their trial protocol and other key study documents.
About this document
The DAC Assessment Tool (DAT) document is a questionnaire developed by the BMGF
DAC team and filled out by grantees that go through the DAC review process.  Besides
serving as a key document for DAC reviews, the DAT questionnaire can also be used
more broadly by Principal Investigators and their teams as a guide for informative
clinical study planning.

The DAT is divided into three sections of clinical study planning topics: general, design,
analyze, and communicate. The DAT questions that focus on study planning details
related to one or more of the 16 best practices for study informativeness are noted with
a number in brackets that corresponds to the specific best practice(s) as listed in Table
1 (please note, there are DAT questions below that cite no, one or multiple best
practices).

Table 1. Best practice research methods for informative clinical trial planning
DAC Best Practices (BP) Definitions
1. Prioritize disease burden and
epidemiology as criteria for study site
selection
9. Design interim analyses with decision rules for
stopping for success or futility early enough to reduce
the number of participants subjected to ineffective
interventions
2. Use accepted and validated endpoints
whenever possible
10. When appropriate, use model-informed drug
development, such as PK/PD modeling
3. Proactively map study outcome to

risks of this proposed study.  Please summarize your mitigation plans for
each.
DESIGN ASPECTS
D1 Describe your rationale for the proposed study location(s) including disease
burden, availability of disease-specific trained staff and facilities, and
assumptions used for expected site recruitment rates. How recent and localized
are your prevalence estimates? [BPs 1, 4, 12]
D2 Describe how the duration of the study is adequate to answer the scientific
question(s), considering the anticipated clinical efficacy effect, as well as
expected duration of effect and risk of treatment failure or relapse. [BP 4]
D3 Detail the main potential sources of bias during the study and how these will be
minimized. [BP 11]
D4 Describe the randomization method, including type of randomization,
stratification factors and other features of the randomization scheme and any
restrictions and methods used to implement. [BP 11]
D5 Please describe your plans for blinding the study. Please describe who will and
will not be blinded to study treatment (e.g., data monitoring committee, steering
committee), and plans for blinding/unblinding study data during the analysis
phase of the study. [BP 11]
D6 Describe your safety monitoring plan including any safety aspects that require
specific monitoring and/or mitigation action. How will safety alerts be handled?
[BP 13]
D7 Describe how the proposed eligibility criteria relate to the population suffering
from, or at risk of, the disease or condition. If this is a cluster randomized trial,
what eligibility criteria will apply to clusters? [BP 1]
D8 What steps will you take to ensure a population as diverse and representative
as possible and appropriate will be included in this study?
D9 Will any restrictions in eligibility affect generalizability? Conversely, are you
planning on restricting eligibility and enriching the population to maximize the
chance of demonstrating efficacy? If so, please expand on the reasons. [BP 3]
D10 Will the effects of biological sex on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
(PK/PD), efficacy, and/or safety be investigated in the study? If so, how, and if
DAT Version 2023
7
not, why not? If both biological sexes are eligible for enrollment, are measures
needed to ensure both have equal opportunity to enroll?
D11 Will this study enroll special populations (e.g., elderly, children, pregnant
women, nursing mothers, HIV-positive individuals)? Describe any special safety
considerations needed to enroll these populations. Is the target population for
clinical use likely to include these groups? If these special populations are
excluded from the study, yet experience the disease, discuss how this gap will be
addressed, and how this will affect the product label or policy considerations on
the use of the intervention in this population. [BPs 3, 13]

https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E11_R1_Addendum.pdf
D12 How do the primary and secondary endpoints address the scientific
question(s) and purpose(s) of the trial? Please describe or reference the general
acceptability of your selected primary and secondary endpoint methodologies. If
no validated or accepted endpoints exist, please detail the input and alignment
on your endpoints that you have received from key disease area stakeholders
(e.g., disease area researchers, policy makers) and any limitations this poses to
the potential informativeness of this study. [BPs 2, 14]
D13 Please describe the rationale for the selection of the time period for measuring
the endpoints. Also describe what is known about the variability of your selected
primary and secondary endpoints. For example, consider diurnal variability,
seasonal and geographic variability, measurement variability, intra-person
variability and spatial variability (if cluster-randomized). [BP 2]
D14 What are the strengths and limitations of these endpoints regarding the
consistency with which they may be ascertained in study subjects? [BP 2]
D15 For endpoints that are based on lab data that are non-routine (e.g., antibody
titers and other biologic assays), and collected at multiple lab locations, please
describe how the endpoint assays are validated across the different labs. [BP 2]
D16 What is the basis for the effect size estimate used to power your study? Is the
study powered to detect the minimally clinically relevant effect size? Describe the
current data or assumptions that justify the response rates and explain if and how
it varies depending on the severity of the disease. [BP 4]
D17 What is the basis for the sample size calculation? Did you use simulation to
perform your sample size calculation, and if not, would you be willing to? [BP 5]
D18 Does the protocol allow for adjustment of sample size based on review of event
rates at baseline, during a run-in period, or during the study? If you are not
presently committed to one, please comment on how a pilot or run-in period
might be a beneficial addition to correct for or improve inputs on actual site-

specific burden of disease, recruitment rates, and other potential inputs. [BPs 4,
13]
D19 Provide a detailed description of the simulations that were conducted as a part
of developing your proposed study design and sample size, and include the
associated code if applicable. Explain how the simulations support your design
as the best one to implement (e.g., adaptive and/or factorial allows testing of
multiple doses/interventions). Have simulations been run on the likely response
rates, disease prevalence, incidence, likely variability of the data, ability to follow
up patients etc.? If simulations were not run, please explain the rationale why
not. [BP 5]
For regulated medicines only:
D20 Describe the dose selection criteria. Please provide background documentation
related to model-informed drug development considerations including PK/PD
assessments, exposure-response modeling, dose ranging studies, or
regimen/dosing frequency studies that support the dose and regimen selection.
Are there any demographic factors (age, sex, body weight, race) that may
influence exposure to the intervention? Have you performed or will you perform
modeling considered model-informed drug development for this trial? [BP 10]
D21 Is the drug or vaccine or product under test currently licensed and being used in
accordance with the license and/or standard of care? If not, do you anticipate
any changes before further studies?
D22 Describe your plans for PK (and, if applicable, PD/biomarker) sampling during
this study. How will results be compared to what is already known about the
disposition of the test medicinal product? How will PK data and parameters be
linked with PD effect, efficacy measures, and/or adverse events? [BP 10]
For regulated medicines or non-regulated interventions only:
D23 Explain how the potential for PK or PD interactions (e.g., drug-drug or between
agents in the study/or food effects or other substances recipients may receive)
have been considered and addressed in your design and inclusion/exclusion
criteria. [BP 10]
For vector control studies only:
D24 Are there plans to monitor environmental impact and minimize any impact?
How will interventions be disposed of at the end of the study?
D25 Are there plans to monitor durability and efficacy over the life of the product?
Please explain the rationale to monitor or not.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUNCTION QUESTIONS:
In this following section, I will ask you about your ability to do specific activities as part of your
daily routines.  I am interested in your sense of your ability to do it on a typical day.  It is not
important that you actually do the activity on a daily basis.  In fact, I may mention some
activities that you don't do at all.  You can still answer these questions by assessing how difficult
you think they would be for you to do on an average day.
Factors that influence the level of difficulty you have may include: pain, fatigue, fear, weakness,
soreness, ailments, health conditions, or disabilities.
I want to know how difficult the activity would be for you to do without the help of someone
else, and without the use of a cane, walker or any other assistive walking device (or wheelchair
or scooter).
Interviewer personal note:
For the Function items, using fixed support is acceptable (e.g. holding onto furniture, walls),
unless otherwise specified in the item.

EXPLANATORY NOTE FOR THE MEMBER OF STAFF COMPLETING THIS FORM
This pupil/student was enrolled at birth in a National Survey of Health and Development. With
the help of his parents and of health visitors, school teachers and nurses, a detailed account has
been obtained of his health and development during the past 17 years. The Survey boys and girls
come from all types of home, and are attending, or have attended all types of school and college, both
local authority and independent: a great number are of course already in employment. Only 2% of those
at school in England, Wales and Scotland have been lost, and the value of this enquiry depends onour
continuing to obtain information for every possible Survey member: the fewer the losses the more
valuable is the information received. We are particularly interested in the group that was still at
school last autumn, and hope that you will be able to give us information about the above-named
pupil's/student's examination record, absences, and leaving date if relevant.

Q1.1
Voluntary Superannuation Contributions
PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET
Project Title: Saving for retirement survey
What is the project about?
The aim of this project is to learn about people's saving behaviour in Australia's retirement system. The survey you are about to undertake will ask you questions about your approach to your retirement planning.
This research is supported by the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).
Why have I been invited to participate?
You have been invited to participate because you are a member of the Qualtrics survey panel.
You can pull out at any time and it won't change your relationship with PM&C, Treasury or anyone else.
What will I need to do?
We will ask you to complete a short survey asking about your pre-retirement plans and decisions around retiring. We expect it to take less than 15 minutes to complete.
What will happen to my information?
Your responses to the survey questions will remain completely anonymous, and you won't be identified in any way. Your responses will only be used for research purposes unless required by law. In particular, your responses will be used to inform the current Retirement Income Review.
Your data will be held securely by PM&C for at least 15 years. It may also be shared with other researchers to inform their work.
What are the potential risks?
We do not think there are any risks to participating in this research.
Contact
If you have any concerns or complaints about this research, please contact BETA at BETA@pmc.gov.au.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
We would like to assess the stage of your physical development using the drawings
on the next pages. These show various stages commonly used by doctors to assess
the growth and development of girls.
We need to know which drawings most closely match
your stage of development at the moment.
Not all teenagers follow the same pattern of development.
Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.

The nipple is raised a little in
this stage. The rest of the
breast is still flat.
This is the breast bud stage. In this
stage the nipple is raised more than in
stage 1. The breast is a small mound.
The dark area around the nipple
(areola) is larger than in stage 1.
The areola and the breast are both
larger than in stage 2. The areola does
not stick out away from the breast
The areola and the nipple make up a
mound that sticks up above the shape
of the breast. (Note: This stage may not
happen at all for some teenagers. Some
teenagers develop from stage 3 to stage
5 with no stage 4.)
This is the mature adult stage. The
breasts are fully developed. Only the
nipple sticks out in this stage. The
areola has moved back in the general
shape of the breast.
Section B
The drawings below show stages of the way the breasts develop. A teenager can
go through each of the five stages shown, although some teenagers skip some
stages. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read the
descriptions.

Cross the box that is the closest to the amount of pubic hair you have.
There is no pubic hair
There is a little long, lightly coloured hair.
This hair may be straight or a little curly.
The hair is darker in this stage. It is coarser
and more curled. It has spread out and thinly

Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)
P A T I E N T  E D U C A T I O N  T O O L S
OVERVIEW
The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The
scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48
hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. The
items are selected based upon published descriptions of the core symptoms of mania. The YMRS follows the style of the
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) with each item given a severity rating. There are four items that are
graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining
seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor
cooperation from severely ill patients. There are well described anchor points for each grade of severity. The authors
encourage the use of whole or half point ratings once experience with the scale is acquired. Typical YMRS baseline scores
can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or
euthymia (YMRS = 2). Sometimes a clinical study entry requirement of YMRS > 20 generates a mean YMRS baseline of
about 30. Strengths of the YMRS include its brevity, widely accepted use, and ease of administration. The usefulness of the
scale is limited in populations with diagnoses other than mania.
The YMRS is a rating scale used to evaluate manic symptoms at baseline and over time in individuals with mania.
The scale is generally done by a clinician or other trained rater with expertise with manic patients and takes 15–30
minutes to complete.

GUIDE FOR SCORING ITEMS:
The purpose of each item is to rate the severity of that abnormality in the patient. When several keys are given for a
particular grade of severity, the presence of only one is required to qualify for that rating.
The keys provided are guides. One can ignore the keys if that is necessary to indicate severity, although this should be
the exception rather than the rule.
Scoring between the points given (whole or half points) is possible and encouraged after experience with the scale is
acquired. This is particularly useful when severity of a particular item in a patient does not follow the progression
indicated by the keys.

Guidelines on Clinical Application of IIEF Patient Questionnaire
Background
The 15-question International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire is a validated, multi-
dimensional, self-administered investigation that has been found useful in the clinical assessment of erectile
dysfunction and treatment outcomes in clinical trials.  A score of 0-5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions
that examine the 4 main domains of male sexual function: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire
and intercourse satisfaction.
In a recent study(1),the IIEF Questionnaire was tested in a series of 111 men with sexual dysfunction and 109
age-matched, normal volunteers.  The following mean scores were recorded:
FUNCTION DOMAIN MAX SCORE CONTROLS PATIENTS
A. Erectile Function (Q1,2,3,4,5,15)
30
25.8
10.7
B. Orgasmic Function (Q9,10) 10 9.8 5.3
C. Sexual Desire (Q11,12) 10 7.0 6.3
D. Intercourse Satisfaction (Q6,7,8) 15 10.6 5.5
E. Overall Satisfaction (Q13,14)
10 8.6 4.4
Clinical Application
IIEF assessment is limited by the superficial assessment of psychosexual background and the very limited
assessment of partner relationship, both important factors in the presentation of male sexual dysfunction.
Analysis of the questionnaire should, therefore, be viewed as an adjunct to, rather than a substitute for, a
detailed sexual history and examination.  The following guide-lines may be applied:
1.  Patients with low IEEF scores (<14 out of 30) in Domain A (Erectile Function) may be considered for a
trial course of therapy with Sildenafil unless contraindicated.  Specialist referral is indicated if this is
unsuccessful.
2.  Patients demonstrating primary orgasmic or ejaculatory dysfunction (Domain B) should be referred for
specialist investigation.
3.  Patients with reduced sexual desire (Domain C) require testing of blood levels of androgen and prolactin.
4.  Psychosexual counselling should be considered if low scores are recorded in Domains D and E but there is
only a moderately lowered score (14 to 25) in Domain A.

EXPLANATORY NOTE FOR THE MEMBER OF STAFF COMPLETING THIS FORM
This pupil or student was enrolled at birth in a National Survey of Health and Development. With the
help of his parents and of health visitors, school teachers and nurses, a detailed account has been obtained
of his health and development during the past 18 years. The Survey pupils and students come from all types
of home, and are attending, or have attended all types of school and college, both local authority and independ-
ent: a great number are of course already in employment. Only 2% of those who were at school in England,
Wales and Scotland have been lost, andthe value of this enquiry depends on our continuing to obtain information
for every possible Survey member: the fewer the losses the more valuable is the information received.
We are particularly interested in the group that was still at school or college last autumn and hope that
you will be able to give us information about the above-named pupil's or student's examination record,
leaving date and present whereabouts. Those entering higher education willbe part of a special study over the
next year of so.
Please return this questionnaire to your Education Authority by the end of November.

Scoring the PSQI
The order of the PSQI items has been modified from the original order in order to
fit the first 9 items (which are the only items that contribute to the total score) on a single
page. Item 10, which is the second page of the scale, does not contribute to the PSQI
score.
In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no
difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global
score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.
Component 1: Subjective sleep quality—question 9

There is always someone I can talk to about

2 I miss having a really close friend

11 I can call on my friends whenever I need them
processing the scale data manually
Step 1
Count the neutral and positive answers ("more or less", "yes", or "yes!") on items 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10. This is the
emotional loneliness score.
Count the missing values (i.e., no answer) on items 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10. This is the missing emotional loneliness
score.
Count the neutral and negative ("no!", "no", or "more or less") answers on items 1, 4, 7, 8, 11. This is the
social loneliness score.
Count the missing values (i.e., no answer) on items 1, 4, 7, 8, 11. This is the missing social loneliness score.
Step 2
Compute the total loneliness score by taking the sum of the emotional loneliness score and the social
loneliness score.
Step 3
The emotional loneliness score is valid only if the missing emotional loneliness score equals 0.
The social loneliness score is valid only if the missing social loneliness score equals 0.
The total loneliness score is valid only if the sum of the missing emotional loneliness score and the missing
social loneliness score equals 0 or 1.
Step 4
If desired, the total loneliness score can be categorized into four levels: not lonely (score 0, 1 or 2), moderate
lonely (score 3 through 8), severe lonely (score 9 or 10), and very severe lonely (score 11).
8 A short scale
A 6-item version for overall, emotional and social loneliness has been developed because the length of the
11-item version has sometimes rendered it difficult to use the scale in large surveys. The construction and
empirically testing is reported in De Jong Gierveld & Van Tilburg (2006). The selected items are:
3. I experience a general sense of emptiness
4. There are plenty of people I can rely on when I have problems
7. There are many people I can trust completely
9. I miss having people around
8. There are enough people I feel close to
10. I often feel rejected
Whether to use the 11-item version or the shortened 6-item version of the loneliness scale is not a neutral
decision. Whereas studies detailing the prevalence of loneliness, or in-depth studies of loneliness among
certain individuals, as well as research into the changing nature and impact of loneliness after specific life
events may benefit from using the 11-item scale, the use of the shortened 6-item loneliness scale may be
sufficient in other studies. In both cases, however, the researcher has a reliable and valid measuring
instrument at hand, which can be used as a unidimensional overall loneliness measure as well as provide
information about the emotional and/or social loneliness situation of respondents.
